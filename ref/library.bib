abstract = {Use of the green fluorescent protein (Gfp) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a powerful method for nondestructive in situ monitoring, since expression of green fluorescence does not require any substrate addition. To expand the use of Gfp as a reporter protein, new variants have been constructed by the addition of short peptide sequences to the C-terminal end of intact Gfp. This rendered the Gfp susceptible to the action of indigenous housekeeping proteases, resulting in protein variants with half-lives ranging from 40 min to a few hours when synthesized in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida. The new Gfp variants should be useful for in situ studies of temporal gene expression.},

abstract = {Although substantial progress has been made recently in understanding the establishment of left-right asymmetry in several organisms [1-4], little is known about the initial step for any embryo. In gastropods, left-right body handedness is determined by an unknown maternally inherited single gene or genes at closely linked loci [5-7] and is associated with the sense of spiral cleavage in early embryos [8-10]. Contrary to what has been believed, we show that temporal and spatial cytoskeletal dynamics for the left- and right-handed snails within a species are not mirror images of each other. Thus, during the third cleavage of Lymnaea stagnalis, helical spindle inclination (SI) and spiral blastomere deformation (SD) are observed only in the dominant dextral embryos at metaphase-anaphase, whereas in the recessive sinistral embryos, helicity emerges during the furrow ingression. Actin depolymerization agents altered both cleavages to neutral. Further, we found a strong genetic linkage between the handedness-specific cytoskeletal organization and the organismal handedness, using backcrossed F4 congenic animals that inherit only 1/16 of dextral strain-derived genome either with or without the dextrality-determining gene(s). Physa acuta, a sinistral-only gastropod, exhibits substantial SD and SI levotropically. Thus, cytoskeletal dynamics have a crucial role in determination of body handedness with further molecular, cellular, and evolutionary implications.},

abstract = {Our understanding of cancer is being transformed by exploring clonal diversity, drug resistance, and causation within an evolutionary framework. The therapeutic resilience of advanced cancer is a consequence of its character as a complex, dynamic, and adaptive ecosystem engendering robustness, underpinned by genetic diversity and epigenetic plasticity. The risk of mutation-driven escape by self-renewing cells is intrinsic to multicellularity but is countered by multiple restraints, facilitating increasing complexity and longevity of species. But our own species has disrupted this historical narrative by rapidly escalating intrinsic risk. Evolutionary principles illuminate these challenges and provide new avenues to explore for more effective control. Signifi cance: Lifetime risk of cancer now approximates to 50{\%} in Western societies. And, despite many advances, the outcome for patients with disseminated disease remains poor, with drug resistance the norm. An evolutionary perspective may provide a clearer understanding of how cancer clones develop robustness and why, for us as a species, risk is now off the scale. And, perhaps, of what we might best do to achieve more effective control.},

abstract = {Transmembrane proteins perform a variety of important biological functions necessary for the survival and growth of the cells. Membrane proteins are built up by transmembrane segments that span the lipid bilayer. The segments can either be in the form of hydrophobic alpha-helices or beta-sheets which create a barrel. A fundamental aspect of the structure of transmembrane proteins is the membrane topology, that is, the number of transmembrane segments, their position in the protein sequence and their orientation in the membrane. Along these lines, many predictive algorithms for the prediction of the topology of alpha-helical and beta-barrel transmembrane proteins exist. The newest algorithms obtain an accuracy close to 80{\%} both for alpha-helical and beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. However, lately it has been shown that the simplified picture presented when describing a protein family by its topology is limited. To demonstrate this, we highlight examples where the topology is either not conserved in a protein superfamily or where the structure cannot be described solely by the topology of a protein. The prediction of these non-standard features from sequence alone was not successful until the recent revolutionary progress in 3D-structure prediction of proteins.},

abstract = {Animals make up only a small fraction of the eukaryotic tree of life, yet, from our vantage point as members of the animal kingdom, the evolution of the bewildering diversity of animal forms is endlessly fascinating. In the century following the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, hypotheses regarding the evolution of the major branches of the animal kingdom - their relationships to each other and the evolution of their body plans - was based on a consideration of the morphological and developmental characteristics of the different animal groups. This morphology-based approach had many successes but important aspects of the evolutionary tree remained disputed. In the past three decades, molecular data, most obviously primary sequences of DNA and proteins, have provided an estimate of animal phylogeny largely independent of the morphological evolution we would ultimately like to understand. The molecular tree that has evolved over the past three decades has drastically altered our view of animal phylogeny and many aspects of the tree are no longer contentious. The focus of molecular studies on relationships between animal groups means, however, that the discipline has become somewhat divorced from the underlying biology and from the morphological characteristics whose evolution we aim to understand. Here, we consider what we currently know of animal phylogeny; what aspects we are still uncertain about and what our improved understanding of animal phylogeny can tell us about the evolution of the great diversity of animal life.},

abstract = {The stereotyped asymmetry of one-cell C. elegans embryos has proven to be an important model for identifying molecular determinants of cell polarity [1]. How polarity is initiated is less well understood. Polarity establishment depends on centrosomes [2-4], which use two molecularly distinct pathways to break symmetry [5-8]. In both, the centrosome's position adjacent to the cell cortex is thought to determine where polarization starts. Defects in centrosome-cortex juxtaposition correlate with defects in polarity establishment in several mutants [4, 9, 10], suggesting that these processes may be linked, but there is no direct test of this. Here we assess how centrosome position relative to the cortex affects polarity establishment. We find that centrosomes can initiate polarity from any position within the embryo volume, but centrosome-cortex proximity decreases the time required to initiate polarity. Polarization itself brings about close centrosome-cortex proximity. Prior to polarization, cytoplasmic microtubules constrain centrosome movement near the cortex, expanding the controversial role of microtubules during polarity establishment [4-6, 11-13]. The ability of centrosomes to induce a single polarity axis from any position within the egg emphasizes the flexible, self-organizing properties of polarization in C. elegans embryos and contrasts the common view of C. elegans development as invariant. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Stamataki2005,
abstract = {During development, many signaling factors behave as morphogens, long-range signals eliciting different cellular responses according to their concentration. In ventral regions of the spinal cord, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is such a signal and controls the emergence, in precise spatial order, of distinct neuronal subtypes. The Gli family of transcription factors plays a central role in this process. Here we demonstrate that a gradient of Gli activity is sufficient to mediate, cell-autonomously, the full range of Shh responses in the neural tube. The incremental two- to threefold changes in Shh concentration, which determine alternative neuronal subtypes, are mimicked by similar small changes in the level of Gli activity, indicating that a gradient of Gli activity represents the intracellular correlate of graded Shh signaling. Moreover, our analysis suggests that cells integrate the level of signaling over time, consistent with the idea that signal duration, in addition to signal strength, is an important parameter controlling dorsal-ventral patterning. Together, these data indicate that Shh signaling is transduced, without amplification, into a gradient of Gli activity that orchestrates patterning of the ventral neural tube. {\textcopyright} 2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Substantial insight has recently been achieved into the mechanisms responsible for the generation of left-right (L-R) asymmetry in the vertebrate body plan. However, the mechanism that underlies the initial breaking of symmetry has remained unclear. In the mouse, a leftward fluid flow on the ventral side of the node caused by the vortical motion of cilia (referred to as nodal flow) is implicated in symmetry breaking, but direct evidence for the role of this flow has been lacking. Here we describe the development of a system in which mouse embryos are cultured under an artificial fluid flow and with which we have examined how flow affects L-R patterning. An artificial rightward flow that was sufficiently rapid to reverse the intrinsic leftward nodal flow resulted in reversal of situs in wild-type embryos. The artificial flow was also able to direct the situs of mutant mouse embryos with immotile cilia. These results provide the first direct evidence for the role of mechanical fluid flow in L-R patterning.},

abstract = {Disorders with overlapping diagnostic features are grouped into a network module. Based on phenotypic similarities or differential diagnoses, it is possible to identify functional pathways leading to individual features. We generated a Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS)-specific network module utilizing patient clinical data, text mining from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, and in vitro functional analysis. We tested our module by functional studies based on a hypothesis that RAI1 acts through phenotype-specific pathways involving several downstream genes, which are altered due to RAI1 haploinsufficiency. A preliminary genome-wide gene expression study was performed using microarrays on RAI1 haploinsufficient cells created by RNAi-based approximately 50{\%} knockdown of RAI1 in HEK293T cells. The top dysregulated genes were involved in growth signaling and insulin sensitivity, neuronal differentiation, lipid biosynthesis and fat mobilization, circadian activity, behavior, renal, cardiovascular and skeletal development, gene expression, and cell-cycle regulation and recombination, reflecting the spectrum of clinical features observed in SMS. Validation using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed the gene expression profile of 75{\%} of the selected genes analyzed in both HEK293T RAI1 knockdown cells and SMS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Overall, these data support a method for identifying genes and pathways responsible for individual clinical features in a complex disorder such as SMS.},

abstract = {The TGF$\beta$ family member Nodal is central to control pluripotent stem cell fate, but its use as a stem cell differentiation factor is limited by low specific activity. During development, Nodal depends on growth and differentiation factor (Gdf)-1 and on the shared co-receptor Cryptic to specify visceral left-right axis asymmetry. We therefore asked whether the functionality of Nodal can be augmented by Gdf1. Because Nodal and Gdf1 coimmunoprecipitate each other, they were predicted to form heterodimers, possibly to facilitate diffusion or to increase the affinity for signaling receptors. Here, we report that Gdf1 suppresses an unexpected dependence of Nodal on serum proteins and that it is critically required for non-autonomous signaling in cells expressing Cryptic. Nodal, Gdf1, and their cleaved propeptides copurified as a heterodimeric low molecular weight complex that stimulated Activin receptor (Acvr) signaling far more potently than Nodal alone. Although heterodimerization with Gdf1 did not increase binding of Nodal to Fc fusions of co-receptors or Acvr extracellular domains, it was essential for soluble Acvr2 to inhibit Nodal signaling. This implies that Gdf1 potentiates Nodal activity by stabilizing a low molecular weight fraction that is susceptible to neutralization by soluble Acvr2. Finally, in differentiating human ES cells, endodermal markers were more efficiently induced by Nodal{\textperiodcentered}Gdf1 than by Nodal, suggesting that Nodal{\textperiodcentered}Gdf1 is an attractive new reagent to direct stem cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in tertiary care hospitals of different European countries and the United States have shown incidence rates of candidemia ranging from 0.17 to 0.76 and 0.28 to 0.96 per 1,000 admissions, respectively. So far, only 1 study has evaluated the incidence rates of candidemia in tertiary care hospitals in Latin American countries.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the epidemiology of candidemia in 4 tertiary care hospitals in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil.

DESIGN: Multicenter, laboratory-based surveillance of candidemia.

RESULTS: A total of 7,038 episodes of bloodstream infection were identified, and Candida species accounted for 282 cases (4{\%}). The incidence rate of candidemia was 1.66 candidemic episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated Candida species in all hospitals, but Candida species other than C. albicans accounted for 62{\%} of isolates, including predominantly Candida parapsilosis and Candida tropicalis. Azole resistance was restricted to only 2{\%} of all Candida isolates (1 isolate of Candida glabrata and 4 isolates of Candida rugosa). Candidemia was mostly documented in surgical patients with long durations of hospital stay. The crude mortality rate was 61{\%}, and advanced age and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were both conditions independently associated with risk of death.

CONCLUSIONS: We observed in our series a higher incidence rate of candidemia than that reported in European countries and the United States. Advanced age and a high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were factors associated with a higher probability of death in candidemic patients. Fluconazole-resistant Candida strains are still a rare finding in our case-based study of candidemia.},

abstract = {In the winter of 1868/9 the young Swiss doctor Friedrich Miescher, working in the laboratory of Felix Hoppe-Seyler at the University of T{\"{u}}bingen, performed experiments on the chemical composition of leukocytes that lead to the discovery of DNA. In his experiments, Miescher noticed a precipitate of an unknown substance, which he characterised further. Its properties during the isolation procedure and its resistance to protease digestion indicated that the novel substance was not a protein or lipid. Analyses of its elementary composition revealed that, unlike proteins, it contained large amounts of phosphorous and, as Miescher confirmed later, lacked sulphur. Miescher recognised that he had discovered a novel molecule. Since he had isolated it from the cells' nuclei he named it nuclein, a name preserved in today's designation deoxyribonucleic acid. In subsequent work Miescher showed that nuclein was a characteristic component of all nuclei and hypothesised that it would prove to be inextricably linked to the function of this organelle. He suggested that its abundance in tissues might be related to their physiological status with increases in "nuclear substances" preceding cell division. Miescher even speculated that it might have a role in the transmission of hereditary traits, but subsequently rejected the idea. This article reviews the events and circumstances leading to Miescher's discovery of DNA and places them within their historic context. It also tries to elucidate why it was Miescher who discovered DNA and why his name is not universally associated with this molecule today. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {The theory of disease transmission provides a consistent framework within which to design, evaluate, and monitor measles elimination programs. Elimination of measles requires maintaining the effective reproduction number R at {\textless}1, by achieving and maintaining low levels of susceptibility. The essential features of different vaccination strategies (e.g., routine versus campaigns, number of doses) can be compared within this framework. Designing an elimination program for a particular population involves setting target levels of susceptibility, establishing the current susceptibility profile, selecting an approach to reduce susceptibility below the target, and selecting an approach to maintain susceptibility below the target. A key indicator of the sustainability of an elimination program is the residual level of susceptibility of a cohort after it has completed its scheduled vaccination opportunities. This can be estimated from vaccination coverage data. The high transmissibility of measles poses a significant challenge to any attempt to eliminate it.},

abstract = {The $\beta$-carbonic anhydrases ($\beta$-CAs) are a diverse but structurally related group of zinc-metalloenzymes found in eubacteria, plant chloroplasts, red and green algae, and in the Archaea. The enzyme catalyzes the rapid interconversion of CO2 and H2O to HCO3− and H+, and is believed to be associated with metabolic enzymes that consume or produce CO2 or HCO3−. For many organisms, $\beta$-CA is essential for growth at atmospheric concentrations of CO2. Of the five evolutionarily distinct classes of carbonic anhydrase, $\beta$-CA is the only one known to exhibit allosterism. Here we review the structure and catalytic mechanism of $\beta$-CA, including the structural basis for allosteric regulation.},

abstract = {Candida glabrata is a yeast pathogen of humans. We have established a tissue culture model to analyze the interaction of C. glabrata with macrophages. Transcript profiling of yeast ingested by macrophages reveals global changes in metabolism as well as increased expression of a gene family (YPS genes) encoding extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked aspartyl proteases. Eight of these YPS genes are found in a cluster that is unique to C. glabrata. Genetic analysis shows that the C. glabrata YPS genes are required for cell wall integrity, adherence to mammalian cells, survival in macrophages and virulence. By monitoring the processing of a cell wall adhesin, Epa1, we also show that Yps proteases play an important role in cell wall re-modeling by removal and release of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall proteins.},

abstract = {Patients with suppressed immunity are at the highest risk for hospital-acquired infections. Among these, invasive candidiasis is the most prevalent systemic fungal nosocomial infection. Over recent decades, the combined prevalence of non- albicans Candida species outranked Candida albicans infections in several geographical regions worldwide, highlighting the need to understand their pathobiology in order to develop effective treatment and to prevent future outbreaks. Candida parapsilosis is the second or third most frequently isolated Candida species from patients. Besides being highly prevalent, its biology differs markedly from that of C. albicans , which may be associated with C. parapsilosis ' increased incidence. Differences in virulence, regulatory and antifungal drug resistance mechanisms, and the patient groups at risk indicate that conclusions drawn from C. albicans pathobiology cannot be simply extrapolated to C. parapsilosis . Such species-specific characteristics may also influence their recognition and elimination by the host and the efficacy of antifungal drugs. Due to the availability of high-throughput, state-of-the-art experimental tools and molecular genetic methods adapted to C. parapsilosis , genome and transcriptome studies are now available that greatly contribute to our understanding of what makes this species a threat. In this review, we summarize 10 years of findings on C. parapsilosis pathogenesis, including the species' genetic properties, transcriptome studies, host responses, and molecular mechanisms of virulence. Antifungal susceptibility studies and clinician perspectives are discussed. We also present regional incidence reports in order to provide an updated worldwide epidemiology summary.},

However the recognition and clustering of homologous domains from sequence databases typically scales quadratically with respect to their size which grows exponentially, making it essential to parallelize these complex bioinformatics applications. Here we demonstrate the parallelization of MKDOM2, the sequential program that has been instrumental in the construction of the PRODOM database of protein domain families. This was challenging because of (1) dependencies between program iterations, (2) their extremely heterogeneous run times and (3) communication bottlenecks that could arise because of the large size of the data. A large scale test of the new program, MPI-MKDOM2, demonstrated its robustness against heterogeneous run times, preparing the grounds for future releases of PRODOM that would otherwise be out of reach with MKDOM2 by several orders of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

However, these attractors may not fully explain the observed behaviour in transient and stochastic environments such as the cell. We show here that even repressilators possess quasi-stable, travelling wave periodic solutions that are reachable, long-lived and robust to parameter changes. These solutions underlie the sustained oscillations observed in even rings in the stochastic regime, even if these circuits are expected to behave as switches. The existence of such solutions can also be exploited for control purposes: operation of the system around the quasi-stable orbit allows us to turn on and off the oscillations reliably and on demand. We illustrate these ideas with a simple protocol based on optical interference that can induce oscillations robustly both in the stochastic and deterministic regimes. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements that can be found throughout bacteria, as well as in other domains of life. Nonetheless, the evolutionary processes underlying the persistence of plasmids are incompletely understood. Bacterial plasmids may encode genes for traits that are sometimes beneficial to their hosts, such as antimicrobial resistance, virulence, heavy metal tolerance, and the catabolism of unique nutrient sources. In the absence of selection for these traits, however, plasmids generally impose a fitness cost on their hosts. As such, plasmid persistence presents a conundrum: models predict that costly plasmids will be lost over time or that beneficial plasmid genes will be integrated into the host genome. However, laboratory and comparative studies have shown that plasmids can persist for long periods, even in the absence of positive selection. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain plasmid persistence, including host-plasmid co-adaptation, plasmid hitchhiking, cross-ecotype transfer, and high plasmid transfer rates, but there is no clear evidence that any one model adequately resolves the plasmid paradox.},

abstract = {Determination of the vertebrate left-right body axis during embryogenesis results in asymmetric development and placement of most inner organs [1, 2]. Although the asymmetric Nodal cascade is conserved in all vertebrates, the mechanism of symmetry breakage has remained controversial [3]. In mammalian and fish embryos, a cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluid is required for initiation of the Nodal cascade. This flow is localized at the posterior notochord ("node") and Kupffer's vesicle, respectively [4-7]. In frog and chick embryos, however, molecular asymmetries are required earlier, from cleavage stages through gastrulation [8, 9]. The validity of a cilia-based mechanism for all vertebrates therefore has been questioned [3]. Here we show that a cilia-driven leftward flow precedes asymmetric nodal expression in the frog Xenopus. Motile monocilia emerged on the gastrocoel roof plate during neurulation and lengthened and polarized from an initially central position to the posterior pole of cells. Concomitantly, a robust leftward fluid flow developed from stage 15 onward, significantly before asymmetric nodal transcription started in the left-lateral-plate mesoderm at stage 19. Injection of 1.5{\%} methylcellulose into the archenteron prevented leftward flow and resulted in laterality defects, demonstrating that the flow itself was required for asymmetric gene expression and organ placement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sequential profiling of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) holds immense promise for early detection of patient progression. However, how to exploit the predic tive power of cfDNA as a liquid biopsy in the clinic remains unclear. RAS pathway aberrations can be tracked in cfDNA to monitor resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In this prospective phase II clinical trial of single-agent cetuximab in RAS wild-type patients, we combine genomic profiling of serial cfDNA and matched sequential tissue biopsies with imaging and mathematical modeling of cancer evolution. We show that a significant proportion of patients defined as RAS wild-type based on diagnostic tissue analysis harbor aberrations in the RAS pathway in pretreatment cfDNA and, in fact, do not benefit from EGFR inhibition. We demonstrate that primary and acquired resistance to cetuximab are often of polyclonal nature, and these dynamics can be observed in tissue and plasma. Furthermore, evolutionary modeling combined with frequent serial sampling of cfDNA allows prediction of the expected time to treatment failure in individual patients. This study demonstrates how integrating frequently sampled longitudinal liquid biopsies with a mathematical framework of tumor evolution allows individualized quantitative forecasting of progression, providing novel opportunities for adaptive personalized therapies. SIGNIFICANCE: Liquid biopsies capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity underpinning resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer. Dense serial sampling is needed to predict the time to treatment failure and generate a window of opportunity for intervention.},

abstract = {While components of the pathway that establishes left-right asymmetry have been identified in diverse animals, from vertebrates to flies, it is striking that the genes involved in the first symmetry-breaking step remain wholly unknown in the most obviously chiral animals, the gastropod snails. Previously, research on snails was used to show that left-right signaling of Nodal, downstream of symmetry breaking, may be an ancestral feature of the Bilateria [1, 2]. Here, we report that a disabling mutation in one copy of a tandemly duplicated, diaphanous-related formin is perfectly associated with symmetry breaking in the pond snail. This is supported by the observation that an anti-formin drug treatment converts dextral snail embryos to a sinistral phenocopy, and in frogs, drug inhibition or overexpression by microinjection of formin has a chirality-randomizing effect in early (pre-cilia) embryos. Contrary to expectations based on existing models [3-5], we discovered asymmetric gene expression in 2- and 4-cell snail embryos, preceding morphological asymmetry. As the formin-actin filament has been shown to be part of an asymmetry-breaking switch in vitro [6, 7], together these results are consistent with the view that animals with diverse body plans may derive their asymmetries from the same intracellular chiral elements [8].},

abstract = {Using patch clamp techniques, we found that the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the apical membrane of A6 distal nephron cells showed a sudden rundown beginning at 4 min after forming the inside-out configuration. This sudden rundown was prevented by addition of anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), and phosphatidylserine (PS) to the "cytoplasmic" bath. Conversely, chelation of endogenous PIP2 with anti-PIP2 antibody, hydrolysis of PIP2 with either exogenous phospholipase C (PLC) or activation of endogenous PLC by extracellular ATP, or application of the positively charged molecule, poly-L-lysine, accelerated channel rundown. However, neutral phosphatidylcholine had no effect on ENaC activity. By two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, we demonstrated that PIP2 and PIP3 significantly increased amiloride-sensitive current in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNAs of rat a-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-ENaC. However, PIP2 and PIP3 did not affect surface expression of ENaC, indicating that PIP2 and PIP3 regulate ENaC at the level of the inner plasma membrane through a mechanism that is independent of ENaC trafficking. These data suggest that anionic phospholipids may mediate the regulation of ENaC by PLC- or phosphoinositide 3-kinase-coupled receptors.},

The mechanism for differential segregation is unknown. Because mouse left-right dynein (LRD) gene mutations result in randomization of visceral organs' laterality, we hypothesized that LRD may also function in selective chromatid segregation. Indeed, upon knock-down by RNA interference methods, LRD depletion disrupts biased segregation. LRD messenger RNA presence or absence correlates with the observed segregation patterns. This work supports the claim that LRD functions in a mechanism for selective chromatid segregation.},

abstract = {Intratumor heterogeneity has been widely reported in human cancers, but our knowledge of how this genetic diversity emerges over time remains limited. A central challenge in studying tumor evolution is the difficulty in collecting longitudinal samples from cancer patients. Consequently, most studies have inferred tumor evolution from single time-point samples, providing very indirect information. These data have led to several competing models of tumor evolution: linear, branching, neutral and punctuated. Each model makes different assumptions regarding the timing of mutations and selection of clones, and therefore has different implications for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that models may change during tumor progression or operate concurrently for different classes of mutations. Finally, we discuss data that supports the theory that most human tumors evolve from a single cell in the normal tissue.

abstract = {Small GTPases use GDP/GTP alternation to actuate a variety of functional switches that are pivotal for cell dynamics. The GTPase switch is turned on by GEFs, which stimulate dissociation of the tightly bound GDP, and turned off by GAPs, which accelerate the intrinsically sluggish hydrolysis of GTP. For Ras, Rho, and Rab GTPases, this switch incorporates a membrane/cytosol alternation regulated by GDIs and GDI-like proteins. The structures and core mechanisms of representative members of small GTPase regulators from most families have now been elucidated, illuminating their general traits combined with scores of unique features. Recent studies reveal that small GTPase regulators have themselves unexpectedly sophisticated regulatory mechanisms, by which they process cellular signals and build up specific cell responses. These mechanisms include multilayered autoinhibition with stepwise release, feedback loops mediated by the activated GTPase, feed-forward signaling flow between regulators and effectors, and a phosphorylation code for RhoGDIs. Theflipside of these highly integrated functions is that they make small GTPase regulators susceptible to biochemical abnormalities that are directly correlated with diseases, notably a striking number of missense mutations in congenital diseases, and susceptible to bacterial mimics of GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs that take command of small GTPases in infections. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of these many facets of small GTPase regulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

Here we present evidence that the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle of the SF1 helicase Upf1 is required for mRNA discrimination during nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Mutations affecting the Upf1 ATPase cycle disrupt the mRNA selectivity of Upf1, leading to indiscriminate accumulation of NMD complexeson both NMD target and non-target mRNAs. In addition, two modulators of NMD-translation and termination codon-proximal poly(A) binding protein-depend onthe ATPase activity of Upf1 to limit Upf1-non-target association. Preferential ATPase-dependent dissociation of Upf1 from non-target mRNAs invitro suggests that selective release ofUpf1 contributes to the ATPase dependence of Upf1 target discrimination. Given the prevalence of helicases in RNA regulation, ATP hydrolysis may be a widely used activity in target RNA discrimination.},

abstract = {Haploinsufficiency of RAI1 results in Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), a disorder characterized by intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, obesity, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and a disrupted circadian sleep-wake pattern. An inverted melatonin rhythm (i.e., melatonin peaks during the day instead of at night) and associated sleep-phase disturbances in individuals with SMS, as well as a short-period circadian rhythm in mice with a chromosomal deletion of Rai1, support SMS as a circadian-rhythm-dysfunction disorder. However, the molecular cause of the circadian defect in SMS has not been described. The circadian oscillator temporally orchestrates metabolism, physiology, and behavior largely through transcriptional modulation. Data support RAI1 as a transcriptional regulator, but the genes it might regulate are largely unknown. Investigation into the role that RAI1 plays in the regulation of gene transcription and circadian maintenance revealed that RAI1 regulates the transcription of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), a key component of the mammalian circadian oscillator that transcriptionally regulates many critical circadian genes. Data further show that haploinsufficiency of RAI1 and Rai1 in SMS fibroblasts and the mouse hypothalamus, respectively, results in the transcriptional dysregulation of the circadian clock and causes altered expression and regulation of multiple circadian genes, including PER2, PER3, CRY1, BMAL1, and others. These data suggest that heterozygous mutation of RAI1 and Rai1 leads to a disrupted circadian rhythm and thus results in an abnormal sleep-wake cycle, which can contribute to an abnormal feeding pattern and dependent cognitive performance. Finally, we conclude that RAI1 is a positive transcriptional regulator of CLOCK, pinpointing a novel and important role for this gene in the circadian oscillator. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

Despite extensive genetic studies demonstrating the importance of these receptor components in embryonic patterning and cancer, the mechanism by which Ptc regulates Smo is not understood. Here we report that Ptc and Smo are not significantly associated within Hh-responsive cells. Furthermore, we show that free Ptc (unbound by Hh) acts sub-stoichiometrically to suppress Smo activity and thus is critical in specifying the level of pathway activity. Patched is a twelve-transmembrane protein with homology to bacterial proton-driven transmembrane molecular transporters; we demonstrate that the function of Ptc is impaired by alterations of residues that are conserved in and required for function of these bacterial transporters. These results suggest that the Ptc tumour suppressor functions normally as a transmembrane molecular transporter, which acts indirectly to inhibit Smo activity, possibly through changes in distribution or concentration of a small molecule.},

abstract = {The CNS is highly regionalized along both its anteropost-erior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes. AP regionalization of the CNS is clearly evident from the localization of the cerebral cortex and eyes at the anterior end and spinal cord at the posterior end. Similarly, different neurons and neural structures originate at specific DV positions of the neural tube; for example, motor and sensory neurons form in the ventral and dorsal spinal cord, respectively; in the brain, structures such as the hypothalamus and the substantia nigra are ventrally positioned, whereas the cerebral cortex and cerebellum occupy dorsal locations. In addition, subtler aspects of neural cell development, such as the rate of proliferation, the timing of differentiation and the targeting of axonal connections, are all tightly dependent on the position of progenitor cells along the AP and DV axes of the CNS 1. This complex anatomical organization of the mature CNS is anticipated by molecular regionalization of the neuroepithelium at early stages of CNS development. The early neural plate is already subdivided into a complex grid of molecularly distinct progenitor regions, each of which expresses specific transcription factors 2,3. Although the expression of most of these transcription factors is sharply confined along both the AP and DV axes, few of them are restricted to a single progenitor domain. Rather, a unique combination of transcription factors is expressed over time in each progenitor domain 4,5 , and it is these transcriptional codes that specify distinct regions of the CNS. The earliest steps of this process seem to be less complex than downstream events, and recently some unifying principles have emerged. First, the initial stages of neural patterning are controlled by secreted extracellular signalling molecules that spread over variable distances across neural tissue. The activities of these signals are spatiotemporally integrated to determine the specific combinations of transcription factors that are activated in distinct AP and DV compartments of the CNS. Second, there are a limited number of signals involved in this process and the reiterated action of these signals at different AP and DV levels is sufficient to account for most CNS patterning and regionalization 6,7. In this review, we discuss new developments in the study of CNS regionalization, focusing on the signalling systems that control the specification of ventral cell types across the CNS. We concentrate on mechanisms of ventral specification operating in the spinal cord, telen cephalon and eye (FIG. 1). These three structures are located at different AP levels of the CNS, and, excitingly, recent research indicates that the ventral patterning of all of these structures can be largely explained by a few conserved basic molecular mechanisms. First, specification of ventral progenitor domains in the CNS requires nodal and hedgehog (HH) signalling, and inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling. Second, HH activity is mostly required to neutralize the repressive form of the GLI3 transcription factor. Third, retinoic acid (RA) is a key signal in the specification of intermediate progenitor domains. Finally, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals are also crucial in ventral CNS pattern-ing, especially in the specification of the most ventral progenitor domains. Taken together, these conserved mechanisms provide a simplified picture of ventral neural patterning, which might be applicable to most of Abstract | Dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube has a crucial role in shaping the functional organization of the CNS. It is well established that hedgehog signalling plays a key role in specifying ventral cell types throughout the neuroectoderm, and major progress has been made in elucidating how hedgehog signalling works in this ventral specification. In addition, other molecular pathways, including nodal, retinoic acid and fibroblast growth factor signalling, have been identified as important molecular cues for ventral patterning of the spinal cord, telencephalon and eye. Here, we discuss recent advances in this field, highlighting the emerging interplay of these signalling pathways in the molecular specification of ventral patterning at different rostrocaudal levels of the CNS.},

abstract = {Modest dietary restriction extends lifespan (LS) in a diverse range of taxa and typically has a larger effect in females than males. Traditionally, this has been attributed to a stronger trade-off between LS and reproduction in females than in males that is mediated by the intake of calories. Recent studies, however, suggest that it is the intake of specific nutrients that extends LS and mediates this trade-off. Here, we used the geometric framework (GF) to examine the sex-specific effects of protein (P) and carbohydrate (C) intake on LS and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that LS was maximized at a high intake of C and a low intake of P in both sexes, whereas nutrient intake had divergent effects on reproduction. Male offspring production rate and LS were maximized at the same intake of nutrients, whereas female egg production rate was maximized at a high intake of diets with a P:C ratio of 1:2. This resulted in larger differences in nutrient-dependent optima for LS and reproduction in females than in males, as well as an optimal intake of nutrients for lifetime reproduction that differed between the sexes. Under dietary choice, the sexes followed similar feeding trajectories regulated around a P:C ratio of 1:4. Consequently, neither sex reached their nutritional optimum for lifetime reproduction, suggesting intralocus sexual conflict over nutrient optimization. Our study shows clear sex differences in the nutritional requirements of reproduction in D. melanogaster and joins the growing list of studies challenging the role of caloric restriction in extending LS.},

The gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and the closely related Lymnaea peregra have both the sinistral (recessive) and the dextral (dominant) snails within a species and the chirality is hereditary, determined by a single locus that functions maternally. 15-18Intriguingly, the handedness-determining gene(s) and the mechanisms are not yet identified. Here we show that in L. stagnalis, the chiral blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage (but not the two-or four-cell stage) determines the leftĝ€"right asymmetry throughout the developmental programme, and acts upstream of the Nodal signalling pathway. Thus, we could demonstrate that mechanical micromanipulation of the third cleavage chirality (from the four-to the eight-cell stage) leads to reversal of embryonic handedness.

These results establish the crucial importance of the maternally determined blastomere arrangement at the eight-cell stage in dictating zygotic signalling pathways in the organismal chiromorphogenesis.

Whether ascribable to diabetes mellitus, to the administration of glucocorticoids, or to the infusion of hyperalimentation fluids, hyperglycemia may impair several mechanisms of humoral host defense, including such varied neutrophil functions as adhesion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis. In addition, binding of glucose to the biochemically active site of the third component of complement C3 inhibits the attachment of this protein to the microbial surface and thereby impairs opsonization. Last, several pathogens frequently encountered in hyperglycemic patients possess unique mechanisms of virulence that flourish in the hyperglycemic environment. Most notable in this regard is the yeast Candida albicans, which expresses a glucose-inducible protein that is structurally and functionally homologous to a complement receptor on mammalian phagocytes. This protein promotes adhesion in the yeast and subverts phagocytosis by the host. Thus, hyperglycemia serves as a central mechanism in the predisposition of hyperglycemic patients to infection.},

A major goal in the field is to understand how embryos initially determine their left and right hand sides, a process known as symmetry breaking. A number of recent studies on several vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms have provided a more complex view on how L/R asymmetry is established, revealing an apparent partition between deuterostomes and protostomes. In deuterostomes, nodal cilia represent a conserved symmetry-breaking process; nevertheless, growing evidence shows the existence of pre-cilia L/R asymmetries involving active ion flows. In protostomes like snails and Drosophila, symmetry breaking relies on different mechanisms, involving, in particular, the actin cytoskeleton and associated molecular motors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen carbonate. CAs are distributed over all the three domains of life and are divided into five distinct evolutionarily unrelated gene families ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\zeta$). In the large fungal kingdom, the majority of fungi encode multiple copies of $\beta$- CAs, with some also possessing genes for $\alpha$-class CAs. Hemiascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts encode one or two $\beta$-CAs, while most of the filamentous ascomycetes have multiple copies of genes encoding $\alpha$-and $\beta$-CAs. The functions of fungal $\beta$-CAs have been investigated intensively, while the role of fungal $\alpha$-CAs is mostly unknown. The $\beta$- CAs are involved in sexual development, CO2-sensing, path- ogenicity, and survival in ambient air. Only recently, re- searchers have begun to use functional and structural data of CAs from pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms to de- velop powerful and effective drugs and inhibitors or to iden- tify enzymes that can be utilized in industrial applications. Despite the large number of fungal CAs known, only five have been characterized structurally: the $\alpha$-CA AoCA of Aspergillus oryzae, the full length $\beta$-CA Can2 from the path- ogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans,the N- terminally truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae $\beta$-CA Nce103, and two $\beta$-CAs of Sordaria macrospora.This re- view focuses on the functional and structural properties of fungal CAs.

abstract = {Some organs in animals display left-right (LR) asymmetry. To better understand LR asymmetric morphogenesis in Drosophila, we studied LR directional rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube. Hindgut epithelial cells adopt a LR asymmetric (chiral) cell shape within their plane, and we refer to this cell behavior as planar cell-shape chirality (PCC). Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-Cad) is distributed to cell boundaries with LR asymmetry, which is responsible for the PCC formation. Myosin ID switches the LR polarity found in PCC and in DE-Cad distribution, which coincides with the direction of rotation. An in silico simulation showed that PCC is sufficient to induce the directional rotation of this tissue. Thus, the intrinsic chirality of epithelial cells in vivo is an underlying mechanism for LR asymmetric tissue morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can cause systemic infections by invading epithelial barriers to gain access to the bloodstream. One of the main reservoirs of C. albicans is the gastrointestinal tract and systemic infections predominantly originate from this niche. In this study, we used scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy, adhesion, invasion and damage assays, fungal mutants and a set of fungal and host cell inhibitors to investigate the interactions of C. albicans with oral epithelial cells and enterocytes. Our data demonstrate that adhesion, invasion and damage by C. albicans depend not only on fungal morphology and activity, but also on the epithelial cell type and the differentiation stage of the epithelial cells, indicating that epithelial cells differ in their susceptibility to the fungus. C. albicans can invade epithelial cells by induced endocytosis and/or active penetration. However, depending on the host cell faced by the fungus, these routes are exploited to a different extent. While invasion into oral cells occurs via both routes, invasion into intestinal cells occurs only via active penetration.},

abstract = {Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by developmental delay and mental retardation, a distinctive behavioral phenotype, and sleep disturbance. We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify genotype-phenotype relationships to further understand the clinical variability and genetic factors involved in SMS. Clinical and molecular information on 105 patients with SMS was obtained through research protocols and a review of the literature and analyzed using Fisher's exact test with two-tailed p values. Several differences in these groups of patients were identified based on genotype and gender. Patients with RAI1 mutation were more likely to exhibit overeating, obesity, polyembolokoilamania, self-hugging, muscle cramping, and dry skin and less likely to have short stature, hearing loss, frequent ear infections, and heart defects when compared with patients with deletion, while a subset of small deletion cases with deletions spanning from TNFRSF13B to MFAP4 was less likely to exhibit brachycephaly, dental anomalies, iris abnormalities, head-banging, and hyperactivity. Significant differences between genders were also identified, with females more likely to have myopia, eating/appetite problems, cold hands and feet, and frustration with communication when compared with males. These results confirm previous findings and identify new genotype-phenotype associations including differences in the frequency of short stature, hearing loss, ear infections, obesity, overeating, heart defects, self-injury, self-hugging, dry skin, seizures, and hyperactivity among others based on genotype. Additional studies are required to further explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype and any potential discrepancies in health care and parental attitudes toward males and females with SMS. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

abstract = {The Goodwin model is a 3-variable model demonstrating the emergence of oscillations in a delayed negative feedback-based system at the molecular level. This prototypical model and its variants have been commonly used to model circadian and other genetic oscillators in biology. The only source of non-linearity in this model is a Hill function, characterizing the repression process. It was mathematically shown that to obtain limit-cycle oscillations, the Hill coefficient must be larger than 8, a value often considered unrealistic. It is indeed difficult to explain such a high coefficient with simple cooperative dynamics. We present here molecular models of the standard Goodwin model, based on single or multisite phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes of a transcription factor, which have been previously shown to generate switch-like responses. We show that when the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes are fast enough, the limit-cycle obtained with a multisite phosphorylation-based mechanism is in very good quantitative agreement with the oscillations observed in the Goodwin model. Conditions in which the detailed mechanism is well approximated by the Goodwin model are given. A variant of the Goodwin model which displays sharp thresholds and relaxation oscillations is also explained by a double phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-based mechanism through a bistable behavior. These results not only provide rational support for the Goodwin model but also highlight the crucial role of the speed of post-translational processes, whose response curve are usually established at a steady state, in biochemical oscillators. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gonze, Abou-Jaoud{\'{e}}.},

abstract = {Candida species cause a variety of mucosal and invasive infections and are, collectively, the most important human fungal pathogens in the developed world. The majority of these infections result from a few related species within the "CUG clade," so named because they use a nonstandard translation for that codon. Some members of the CUG clade, such as Candida albicans, present significant clinical problems, whereas others, such as Candida (Meyerozyma) guilliermondii, are uncommon in patients. The differences in incidence rates are imperfectly correlated with virulence in animal models of infection, but comparative analyses that might provide an explanation for why some species are effective pathogens and others are not have been rare or incomplete. To better understand the phenotypic basis for these differences, we characterized eight CUG clade species--C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, Clavispora lusitaniae, M. guilliermondii, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Lodderomyces elongisporus--for host-relevant phenotypes, including nutrient utilization, stress tolerance, morphogenesis, interactions with phagocytes, and biofilm formation. Two species deviated from expectations based on animal studies and human incidence. C. dubliniensis was quite robust, grouping in nearly all assays with the most virulent species, C. albicans and C. tropicalis, whereas C. parapsilosis was substantially less fit than might be expected from its clinical importance. These findings confirm the utility of in vitro measures of virulence and provide insight into the evolution of virulence in the CUG clade.},

abstract = {Background. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome associated with a hemizygous deletion of chromosome 17, band p11.2. Characteristic features include neurobehavioural abnormalities such as aggressive and self-injurious behaviour and significant sleep disturbances. The majority of patients have a common deletion characterised at the molecular level. Physical mapping studies indicate that all patients with the common deletion are haploinsufficient for subunit 3 of the COP9 signalosome (COPS3), which is conserved from plants to humans, and in the plant Arabidopis thaliana regulates gene transcription in response to light. Haploinsufficiency of this gene is hypothesised to be potentially involved in the sleep disturbances seen in these patients. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland. SMS patients are reported to have fewer sleep disturbances when given a night time dose of this sleep inducing hormone. Methods. Urinary excretion of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), the major hepatic metabolite of melatonin, in 19 SMS patients were measured in conjunction with 24 hour sleep studies in 28 SMS patients. Five of the 28 patients did not have the common SMS deletion. To investigate a potential correlation of COPS3 haploinsufficiency and disturbed melatonin excretion, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using two BACs containing coding exons of COPS3. Results. All SMS patients show significant sleep disturbances when assessed by objective criteria. Abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of aMT6s were observed in all but one SMS patient. Interestingly this patient did not have the common deletion. All patients studied, including the one patient with a normal melatonin rhythm, were haploinsufficient for COPS3. Conclusions. Our data indicate a disturbed circadian rhythm in melatonin and document the disturbed sleep pattern in Smith-Magenis syndrome. Our findings suggest that the abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of melatonin and altered sleep patterns could be secondary to aberrations in the production, secretion, distribution, or metabolism of melatonin; however,a direct role for COPS3 could not be established.},

abstract = {Monocilia have been proposed to establish the left-right (LR) body axis in vertebrate embryos by creating a directional fluid flow that triggers asymmetric gene expression. In zebrafish, dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) express a conserved ciliary dynein gene (left-right dynein-related1, lrdr1) and form a ciliated epithelium inside a fluid-filled organ called Kupffer's vesicle (KV). Here, videomicroscopy demonstrates that cilia inside KV are motile and create a directional fluid flow just prior to the onset of asymmetric gene expression in lateral cells. Laser ablation of DFCs and surgical disruption of KV provide direct evidence that ciliated KV cells are required during early somitogenesis for subsequent LR patterning in the brain, heart and gut. Antisense morpholinos against lrdr1 disrupt KV fluid flow and perturb LR development. Furthermore, lrdr1 morpholinos targeted to DFC/KV cells demonstrate that lrdr1 functions in these ciliated cells to control LR patterning. This provides the first direct evidence, in any vertebrate, that impairing cilia function in derivatives of the dorsal organizer, and not in other cells that express ciliogenic genes, alters LR development. Finally, genetic analysis reveals novel roles for the T-box transcription factor no tail and the Nodal signaling pathway as upstream regulators of lrdr1 expression and KV morphogenesis. We propose that KV is a transient embryonic 'organ of asymmetry' that directs LR development by establishing a directional fluid flow. These results suggest that cilia are an essential component of a conserved mechanism that controls the transition from bilateral symmetry to LR asymmetry in vertebrates.},

Diagnostic strategies include molecular identification of a 17p11.2 microdeletion encompassing RAI1 or a mutation in RAI1. G-banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are the classical methods used to detect the SMS deletions, while multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and real-time quantitative PCR are the newer, cost-effective, and high-throughput technologies. Most SMS features are due to RAI1 haploinsufficiency, while the variability and severity of the disorder are modified by other genes in the 17p11.2 region. The functional role for RAI1 is not completely understood, but it is likely involved in transcription, based on homology and preliminary studies. Management of SMS is primarily a multidisciplinary approach and involves treatment for sleep disturbance, speech and occupational therapies, minor medical interventions, and management of behaviors.},

abstract = {Similar to obesity, aging is associated with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance. Inflammation in adipose tissue, mainly evidenced by increased accumulation and proinflammatory polarization of T cells and macrophages, has been well-documented in obesity and may contribute to the associated metabolic dysfunctions including insulin resistance. Studies show that increased inflammation, including inflammation in adipose tissue, also occurs in aging, so-called "inflamm-aging." Aging-associated inflammation in adipose tissue has some similarities but also differences compared to obesity-related inflammation. In particular, conventional T cells are elevated in adipose tissue in both obesity and aging and have been implicated in metabolic functions in obesity. However, the changes and also possibly functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) in adipose tissue are different in aging and obesity. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in research on the changes of these immune cells in adipose tissue with aging and obesity and discuss their possible contributions to metabolism and the potential of these immune cells as novel therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases associated with aging or obesity.},

abstract = {Cilia, as motile and sensory organelles, have been implicated in normal development, as well as diseases including cystic kidney disease, hydrocephalus and situs inversus. In kidney epithelia, cilia are proposed to be non-motile sensory organelles, while in the mouse node, two cilia populations, motile and non-motile have been proposed to regulate situs. We show that cilia in the zebrafish larval kidney, the spinal cord and Kupffer's vesicle are motile, suggesting that fluid flow is a common feature of each of these organs. Disruption of cilia structure or motility resulted in pronephric cyst formation, hydrocephalus and left-right asymmetry defects. The data show that loss of fluid flow leads to fluid accumulation, which can account for organ distension pathologies in the kidney and brain.

abstract = {Anamniotes, fishes and amphibians, have the capacity to regenerate spinal cord tissue after injury, generating new neurons that mature and integrate into the spinal circuitry. Elucidating the molecular signals that promote this regeneration is a fundamental question in regeneration research. Model systems, such as salamanders and larval and adult zebrafish are used to analyse successful regeneration. This shows that many developmental signals, such as Notch, Hedgehog (Hh), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Wnt, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Retinoic Acid (RA) and neurotransmitters are redeployed during regeneration and activate resident spinal progenitor cells. Here we compare the roles of these signals in spinal cord development and regeneration of the much larger and fully patterned adult spinal cord. Understanding how developmental signalling systems are reactivated in successfully regenerating species may ultimately lead to ways to reactivate similar systems in mammalian progenitor cells, which do not show neurogenesis after spinal injury.},

C. parapsilosis candidemia was associated with neutropenia (p=0.005), tunneled central venous catheter (p=0.005) and cancer chemotherapy (p=0.03). By multivariate analysis, candidemia due to C. parapsilosis was associated with the presence of a tunneled central venous catheter (relative risk 3.71, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.28-10.70). Except for a single isolate of C. parapsilosis that exhibited MIC {\textgreater}1 microg/ml to amphotericin B, no resistance was observed in 166 isolates tested against fluconazole, itraconazole, 5-flucytosine and amphotericin B. The caspofungin MIC values of C. parapsilosis isolates were significantly higher than those exhibited by C. albicans isolates (p{\textless}0.001). The overall mortality of patients with candidemia due to C. parapsilosis was significantly lower (45{\%} vs. 62{\%}, p=0.03). The association between C. parapsilosis candidemia and a tunneled central venous catheter supports the idea that the main mode of acquisition of C. parapsilosis is from an external source.},

The main outcome of centrosome reproduction is the transmission of polarity to daughter cells and, in most animal species, the sperm-donated centrosome defines embryo polarity.

abstract = {Candida albicans is a component of the normal flora of the alimentary tract and also is found on the mucocutaneous membranes of the healthy host. Candida is the leading cause of invasive fungal disease in premature infants, diabetics, and surgical patients, and of oropharyngeal disease in AIDS patients. As the induction of cell-mediated immunity to Candida is of critical importance in host defense, we sought to determine whether human dendritic cells (DC) could phagocytose and degrade Candida and subsequently present Candida antigens to T cells. Immature DC obtained by culture of human monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 phagocytosed unopsonized Candida in a time-dependent manner, and phagocytosis was not enhanced by opsonization of Candida in serum. Like macrophages (Mphi), DC recognized Candida by the mannose-fucose receptor. Upon ingestion, DC killed Candida as efficiently as human Mphi, and fungicidal activity was not enhanced by the presence of fresh serum. Although phagocytosis of Candida by DC stimulated the production of superoxide anion, inhibitors of the respiratory burst (or NO production) did not inhibit killing of Candida, even when phagocytosis was blocked by preincubation of DC with cytochalasin D. Further, although apparently only modest phagolysosomal fusion occurred upon DC phagocytosis of Candida, killing of Candida under anaerobic conditions was almost equivalent to killing under aerobic conditions. Finally, DC stimulated Candida-specific lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner after phagocytosis of both viable and heat-killed Candida cells. These data suggest that, in vivo, such interactions between DC and C. albicans may facilitate the induction of cell-mediated immunity.},

abstract = {Cardiac Na+,Ca2+ exchange is activated by a mechanism that requires hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but is not mediated by protein kinases. In giant cardiac membrane patches, ATP acted to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from phosphatidylinositol (PI). The action of ATP was abolished by a PI-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and recovered after addition of exogenous PI; it was reversed by a PIP2-specific PLC; and it was mimicked by exogenous PIP2. High concentrations of free Ca2+ (5 to 20 $\mu$M) accelerated reversal of the ATP effect, and PLC activity in myocyte membranes was activated with a similar Ca2+ dependence. Aluminum reversed the ATP effect by binding with high affinity to PIP2. ATP-inhibited potassium channels (K(ATP)) were also sensitive to PIP2, whereas Na+, K+ pumps and Na+ channels were not. Thus, PIP2 may be an important regulator of both ion transporters and channels.},

Here we revisit the first synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator, and modify it using principles from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for circuit design in synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen carbonate. CAs are distributed over all the three domains of life and are divided into five distinct evolutionarily unrelated gene families ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\zeta$). In the large fungal kingdom, the majority of fungi encode multiple copies of $\beta$-CAs, with some also possessing genes for $\alpha$-class CAs. Hemiascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts encode one or two $\beta$-CAs, while most of the filamentous ascomycetes have multiple copies of genes encoding $\alpha$- and $\beta$-CAs. The functions of fungal $\beta$-CAs have been investigated intensively, while the role of fungal $\alpha$-CAs is mostly unknown. The $\beta$-CAs are involved in sexual development, CO2-sensing, pathogenicity, and survival in ambient air. Only recently, researchers have begun to use functional and structural data of CAs from pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms to develop powerful and effective drugs and inhibitors or to identify enzymes that can be utilized in industrial applications. Despite the large number of fungal CAs known, only five have been characterized structurally: the $\alpha$-CA AoCA of Aspergillus oryzae, the full length $\beta$-CA Can2 from the pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, the N-terminally truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae $\beta$-CA Nce103, and two $\beta$-CAs of Sordaria macrospora. This review focuses on the functional and structural properties of fungal CAs.},

Its inhibition with anions and sulfonamides has been investigated, as well as its activation with amines and amino acids. Bromide, iodide and sulfamide, were the best anion inhibitors, with K(I)s of 8.7 - 10.8 µM. Benzenesulfonamides substituted in 2-, 4- and 3,4-positions with amino, alkyl, halogeno and hydroxyalkyl moieties had K(I)s in the range of 0.976 - 18.45 µM. Better inhibition (K(I)s in the range of 154 - 654 nM) was observed for benzenesulfonamides incorporating aminoalkyl/carboxyalkyl moieties or halogenosulfanilamides; benzene-1,3-disulfonamides; simple heterocyclic sulfonamides and sulfanilyl-sulfonamides. The clinically used sulfonamides/sulfamate (acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, methazolamide, dorzolamide, topiramate, celecoxib, etc.) generally showed effective scCA inhibitory activity, with K(I)s in the range of 82.6 - 133 nM. The best inhibitor (K(I) of 15.1 nM) was 4-(2-amino-pyrimidin-4-yl)-benzenesulfonamide. L-adrenaline and some piperazines incorporating aminoethyl moieties were the most effective scCA activators. These studies may lead to a better understanding of the role of this enzyme in yeasts/fungi, and since the Nce103 gene is also present in many pathogenic organisms (Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, etc) they may be useful to develop antifungal drugs.},

We report the molecular and genotype-phenotype analyses of 31 patients with SMS who carry 17p11.2 deletions or mutations in the RAI1 gene. METHODS: Patients with SMS were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or sequencing of RAI1 to identify 17p11.2 deletions or intragenic mutations, respectively, and were compared for 30 characteristic features of this disorder by the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: In our cohort, 8 of 31 individuals carried a common 3.5 Mb deletion, whereas 10 of 31 individuals carried smaller deletions, two individuals carried larger deletions, and one individual carried an atypical 17p11.2 deletion. Ten patients with nondeletion harbored a heterozygous mutation in RAI1. Phenotypic comparison between patients with deletions and patients with RAI1 mutations show that 21 of 30 SMS features are the result of haploinsufficiency of RAI1, whereas cardiac anomalies, speech and motor delay, hypotonia, short stature, and hearing loss are associated with 17p11.2 deletions rather than RAI1 mutations (P{\textless}.05). Further, patients with smaller deletions show features similar to those with RAI1 mutations. CONCLUSION: Although RAI1 is the primary gene responsible for most features of SMS, other genes within 17p11.2 contribute to the variable features and overall severity of the syndrome.},

abstract = {We recently reported that spliceosomes alter messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) composition by depositing several proteins 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions. When assembled in vitro, this so-called 'exon-exon junction complex' (EJC) contains at least five proteins: SRm160, DEK, RNPS1, Y14 and REF. To better investigate its functional attributes, we now describe a method for generating spliced mRNAs both in vitro and in vivo that either do or do not carry the EJC. Analysis of these mRNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that this complex is the species responsible for enhancing nucleocytoplasmic export of spliced mRNAs. It does so by providing a strong binding site for the mRNA export factors REF and TAP/p15. Moreover, by serving as an anchoring point for the factors Upf2 and Upf3, the EJC provides a direct link between splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Finally, we show that the composition of the EJC is dynamic in vivo and is subject to significant evolution upon mRNA export to the cytoplasm.},

The MICs for seven antifungal agents were determined in a central laboratory (JMI Laboratories, North Liberty, IA) using testing methods promulgated by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). The rank order of Candida spp. occurrence was as follows: C. albicans (48.7{\%}), C. parapsilosis (17.3{\%}), C. glabrata (17.2{\%}), C. tropicalis (10.9{\%}), C. krusei (1.9{\%}), and other Candida spp. (4.0{\%}). C. albicans accounted for 51.5, 47.8, and 36.5{\%} of candidal infections in North America, Europe, and Latin America, respectively. Ravuconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole were highly active against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis, with both former agents being more potent (MIC at which 90{\%} of the isolates tested are inhibited [MIC90] of {\textless} or =0.008 to 0.12 microg/ml) than fluconazole (MIC90 of 0.5 to 2 microg/ml). C. glabrata isolates were less susceptible to these agents, with MIC90s of 1, 1, and 64 microg/ml, respectively. Ravuconazole and voriconazole were the most active agents tested against C. krusei (MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml). Among Aspergillus spp., A. fumigatus was the most commonly (71.2{\%} of isolates) recovered species; 96.2, 96.2, 84.6, and 11.5{\%} of strains were inhibited by {\textless} or =1 microg/ml of ravuconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B, respectively. Of the antifungal agents tested, ravuconazole and voriconazole displayed the greatest spectrum of activity against pathogenic Candida and Aspergillus spp., regardless of geographic origin. These results extend upon previous findings from SENTRY Program reports (1997 to 2000), further characterizing species composition as seen in local clinical practice and demonstrating the potent activity of selected, newer triazole antifungal agents.},

abstract = {What drives the formation of chromatin loops has been a long-standing question in chromosome biology. Recent work provides major insight into the basic principles behind loop formation. Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes, that are conserved from bacteria to humans, are key to this process. The SMC family includes condensin and cohesin, which structure chromosomes to enable mitosis and long-range gene regulation. We discuss novel insights into the mechanism of loop formation and the implications for how these complexes ultimately shape chromosomes. A picture is emerging in which these complexes form small loops that they then processively enlarge. It appears that SMC complexes act by family-wide basic principles, with complex-specific levels of control.},

abstract = {Biased left-right asymmetry is a fascinating and medically important phenomenon. We provide molecular genetic and physiological characterization of a novel, conserved, early, biophysical event that is crucial for correct asymmetry: H+ flux. A pharmacological screen implicated the H+-pump H+-V-ATPase in Xenopus asymmetry, where it acts upstream of early asymmetric markers. Immunohistochemistry revealed an actin-dependent asymmetry of H+-V-ATPase subunits during the f irst three cleavages. H+-f lux across plasma membranes is also asymmetric at the four- and eight-cell stages, and this asymmetry requires H+I-V-ATPase activity. Abolishing the asymmetry in H+ flux, using a dominant-negative subunit of the H+-V-ATPase or an ectopic H+ pump, randomized embryonic situs without causing any other defects. To understand the mechanism of action of H+-V-ATPase, we isolated its two physiological functions, cytoplasmic pH and membrane voltage (Vmem) regulation. Varying either pH or Vmem, independently of direct manipulation of H+I-V-ATPase, caused disruptions of normal asymmetry, suggesting roles for both functions. V-ATPase inhibition also abolished the normal early localization of serotonin, functionally linking these two early asymmetry pathways. The involvement of H+-V-ATPase in asymmetry is conserved to chick and zebrafish. Inhibition of the H+-V-ATPase induces heterotaxia in both species; in chick, H+-V-ATPase activity is upstream of Shh; in fish, it is upstream of Kupffer's vesicle and Spaw expression. Our data implicate H+-V-ATPase activity in patterning the LR axis of vertebrates and reveal mechanisms upstream and downstream of its activity. We propose a pH- and Vmem-dependent model of the early physiology of LR patterning.},

In this signaling pathway, the N-terminally palmitoylated and C-terminally cholesterylated HH ligand is secreted into the extracellular space with help of the Dispatched-1 (DISP1) and Scube2 proteins. The Patched-1 (PTCH1) protein releases its inhibition of the oncoprotein Smoothened (SMO) after binding the HH ligand, triggering downstream signaling events. In this review, we discuss the recent structural and biochemical studies on four major components of the HH pathway: the HH ligand, DISP1, PTCH1, and SMO.

abstract = {Mating causes many changes in physiology, behavior, and gene expression in a wide range of organisms. These changes are predicted to be sex specific, influenced by the divergent reproductive roles of the sexes. In female insects, mating is associated with an increase in egg production which requires high levels of nutritional input with direct consequences for the physiological needs of individual females. Consequently, females alter their nutritional acquisition in line with the physiological demands imposed by mating. Although much is known about the female mating-induced nutritional response, far less is known about changes in males. In addition, it is unknown whether variation between genotypes translates into variation in dietary behavioral responses. Here we examine mating-induced shifts in male and female dietary preferences across genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. We find sex- and genotype-specific effects on both the quantity and quality of the chosen diet. These results contribute to our understanding of sex-specific metabolism and reveal genotypic variation that influences responses to physiological demands.},

To understand the molecular impact of ALS-causing mutations on neuronal development and disease, we analysed transcriptomes during in vitro differentiation of motor neurons (MNs) from human control and patient-specific VCP mutant induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We identify increased intron retention (IR) as a dominant feature of the splicing programme during early neural differentiation. Importantly, IR occurs prematurely in VCP mutant cultures compared with control counterparts. These aberrant IR events are also seen in independent RNAseq data sets from SOD1- and FUS-mutant MNs. The most significant IR is seen in the SFPQ transcript. The SFPQ protein binds extensively to its retained intron, exhibits lower nuclear abundance in VCP mutant cultures and is lost from nuclei of MNs in mouse models and human sporadic ALS. Collectively, we demonstrate SFPQ IR and nuclear loss as molecular hallmarks of familial and sporadic ALS.},

Despite this effort, general, predictive models of enhancer function are currently lacking. Here we combine quantitative models of enhancer function with manipulations using engineered transcription factors to examine the extent to which enhancer function can be controlled in a quantitatively predictable manner. Our models, which incorporate few free parameters, can accurately predict the contributions of ectopic transcription factor inputs. These models allow the predictable 'tuning' of enhancers, providing a framework for the quantitative control of enhancers with engineered transcription factors.},

Errors of left-right patterning present an important class of human birth defects, and considerable controversy exists about the nature and evolutionary conservation of the molecular mechanisms that allow embryos to reliably orient the left-right axis. Here we show that the same mutations in the cytoskeletal protein tubulin that alter asymmetry in plants also affect very early steps of left-right patterning in nematode and frog embryos, as well as chirality of human cells in culture. In the frog embryo, tubulin $\alpha$ and tubulin $\gamma$-associated proteins are required for the differential distribution of maternal proteins to the left or right blastomere at the first cell division. Our data reveal a remarkable molecular conservation of mechanisms initiating left-right asymmetry. The origin of laterality is cytoplasmic, ancient, and highly conserved across kingdoms, a fundamental feature of the cytoskeleton that underlies chirality in cells and multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are involved in inorganic carbon utilization. They have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta- CAs, with beta-CAs present in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of beta-CA Nce103/YNL036W. RESULTS: We determined the crystal structure of Nce103 in complex with a substrate analog at 2.04 A resolution. It assembles as a homodimer, with the active site located at the interface between two monomers. At the bottom of the substrate pocket, a zinc ion is coordinated by the three highly conserved residues Cys57, His112 and Cys115 in addition to a water molecule. Residues Asp59, Arg61, Gly111, Leu102, Val80, Phe75 and Phe97 form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a molecule of the substrate analog acetate. Activity assays of full length and two truncated versions of Nce103 indicated that the N-terminal arm is indispensable. CONCLUSION: The quaternary structure of Nce103 resembles the typical plant type beta-CAs of known structure, with an N-terminal arm indispensable for the enzymatic activity. Comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the substrate to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped substrate pocket.},

abstract = {The incidence of infections caused by Candida species (candidosis) has increased considerably over the past three decades, mainly due to the rise of the AIDS epidemic, an increasingly aged population, higher numbers of immunocompromised patients and the more widespread use of indwelling medical devices. Candida albicans is the main cause of candidosis; however, non-C. albicans Candida (NCAC) species such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis are now frequently identified as human pathogens. The apparent increased emergence of these species as human pathogens can be attributed to improved identification methods and also associated with the degree of diseases of the patients, the interventions that they were subjected and the drugs used. Candida pathogenicity is facilitated by a number of virulence factors, most importantly adherence to host surfaces including medical devices, biofilm formation and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. proteases, phospholipases and haemolysins). Furthermore, despite extensive research to identify pathogenic factors in fungi, particularly in C. albicans, relatively little is known about NCAC species. This review provides information on the current state of knowledge on the biology, identification, epidemiology, pathogenicity and antifungal resistance of C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis.},

abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). SMG-1 and Upf1 transiently form a surveillance complex termed "SURF" that includes eRF1 and eRF3 on post-spliced mRNAs during recognition of PTC. If an exon junction complex (EJC) exists downstream from the SURF complex, SMG-1 phosphorylates Upf1, the step that is a rate-limiting for NMD. We provide evidence of an association between the SURF complex and the ribosome in association with mRNPs, and we suggest that the SURF complex functions as a translation termination complex during NMD. We identified SMG-8 and SMG-9 as novel subunits of the SMG-1 complex. SMG-8 and SMG-9 suppress SMG-1 kinase activity in the isolated SMG-1 complex and are involved in NMD in both mammals and nematodes. SMG-8 recruits SMG-1 to the mRNA surveillance complex, and inactivation of SMG-8 induces accumulation of a ribosome:Upf1:eRF1:eRF3:EJC complex on mRNP, which physically bridges the ribosome and EJC through eRF1, eRF3, and Upf1. These results not only reveal the regulatory mechanism of SMG-1 kinase but also reveal the sequential remodeling of the ribosome:SURF complex to the predicted DECID (DECay InDucing) complex, a ribosome:SURF:EJC complex, as a mechanism of in vivo PTC discrimination. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN.},

abstract = {Oncogenic RAS proteins, which are mutated in approximately 24{\%} of all human cancers, have earned a well-deserved reputation as being "undruggable." However, several studies have challenged that reputation. With the first small molecules that directly target one oncogenic RAS mutant (G12C) undergoing clinical evaluation, there have been substantial advances in finding anti-RAS therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, new insights have come from the growing appreciation that neither all RAS proteins (HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS4A/KRAS4B) nor all oncogenic RAS mutations (such as at residues Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61) have the same impact on RAS signaling and function. The role of the nonmutated, wild-type RAS proteins in the context of mutant RAS is increasingly considered to be targetable, with reports of strategies that directly disrupt either the RAS interaction with activating guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) or receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated and GEF-dependent RAS activation (such as by targeting the scaffolding phosphatase SHP2). Last, the development of agents that target downstream effectors of RAS signaling has advanced substantially. In this review, we highlight some important trends in the targeting of RAS proteins in cancer.},

abstract = {The structural framework of the rat liver nucleus has been identified and consists of a nuclear protein matrix. This matrix is 98.4{\%} protein, 0.1{\%} DNA, 1.2{\%} RNA, and 0.5{\%} phospholipid. The nuclear protein matrix is composed primarily of three acidic polypeptide fractions in the molecular weight range of 60-70,000 daltons. We have observed that isolated rat liver nuclei maintain a stable residual nuclear structure following a wide variety of chemical treatments and extractions that remove many of the major components of the nucleus. In contrast, these residual structures were disrupted easily by very mild digestion with proteases such as trypsin or pronase. This suggested that the nucleus might be composed of a residual protein matrix which provides a framework structure for maintaining the spherical shape of the nucleus, and that the actual skeletal elements of the nuclear matrix might be specific nuclear proteins. In an attempt to identify and characterize the nuclear matrix, isolated rat liver nuclei were sequentially treated to remove essentially all of the chromatin, DNA, RNA, and phospholipid components. These combined treatments leave a spherical particle representing the residual nucleus and this structure is over 98{\%} protein in composition. Consistent with these findings, other investigators have observed structures in nuclei after extraction of chromatin.

abstract = {Type II restriction-modification (R-M) systems encode a restriction endonuclease that cleaves DNA at specific sites, and a methyltransferase that modifies same sites protecting them from restriction endonuclease cleavage. Type II R-M systems benefit bacteria by protecting them from bacteriophages. Many type II R-M systems are plasmid-based and thus capable of horizontal transfer. Upon the entry of such plasmids into a na{\"{i}}ve host with unmodified genomic recognition sites, methyltransferase should be synthesized first and given sufficient time to methylate recognition sites in the bacterial genome before the toxic restriction endonuclease activity appears. Here, we directly demonstrate a delay in restriction endonuclease synthesis after transformation of Escherichia coli cells with a plasmid carrying the Esp1396I type II R-M system, using single-cell microscopy. We further demonstrate that before the appearance of the Esp1396I restriction endonuclease the intracellular concentration of Esp1396I methyltransferase undergoes a sharp peak, which should allow rapid methylation of host genome recognition sites. A mathematical model that satisfactorily describes the observed dynamics of both Esp1396I enzymes is presented. The results reported here were obtained using a functional Esp1396I type II R-M system encoding both enzymes fused to fluorescent proteins. Similar approaches should be applicable to the studies of other R-M systems at single-cell level.},

abstract = {The serpinopathies are a family of diseases characterized by the accumulation of ordered polymers of mutant protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. They are a diverse group including $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency and the inherited dementia familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies or FENIB. We have used transient transfection of COS7 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, PC12 cell lines that conditionally express wild type and mutant neuroserpin and fly models of FENIB to assess the cellular handling of wild type and mutant serpins. By using a polymer-specific monoclonal antibody, we show that mutant neuroserpin forms polymers after a delay of at least 30 min and that polymers can be cleared in PC12 cell lines and from the brain in a fly model of FENIB. At steady state, the fractions of intracellular polymerogenic G392E mutant neuroserpin in the monomeric and polymeric states are comparable. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 reveals that both mutant neuroserpin and $\alpha$1-antitrypsin are degraded predominantly by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Pharmacological and genetic inhibitions demonstrate that autophagy is responsible for bulk turnover of wild type and mutant serpins, but can be stimulated by rapamycin to compensate for proteasome inhibition. The significance of these findings to the treatment of serpinopathies is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Gap junctions (GJs) are aqueous channels that allow cells to communicate via physiological signals directly. The role of gap junctional connectivity in determining single-cell functions has long been recognized. However, GJs have another important role: the regulation of large-scale anatomical pattern. GJs are not only versatile computational elements that allow cells to control which small molecule signals they receive and emit, but also establish connectivity patterns within large groups of cells. By dynamically regulating the topology of bioelectric networks in vivo, GJs underlie the ability of many tissues to implement complex morphogenesis. Here, a review of recent data on patterning roles of GJs in growth of the zebrafish fin, the establishment of left-right patterning, the developmental dysregulation known as cancer, and the control of large-scale head-tail polarity, and head shape in planarian regeneration has been reported. A perspective in which GJs are not only molecular features functioning in single cells, but also enable global neural-like dynamics in non-neural somatic tissues has been proposed. This view suggests a rich program of future work which capitalizes on the rapid advances in the biophysics of GJs to exploit GJ-mediated global dynamics for applications in birth defects, regenerative medicine, and morphogenetic bioengineering. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

I describe how asymmetric signals are generated in the embryo. Using the limbs and somites as major examples, I then address mechanisms for protecting symmetrically forming tissues from asymmetrically acting signals. These examples reveal that symmetry should not be considered as an inherent background state, but instead must be actively maintained throughout multiple phases of embryonic patterning and organismal growth.},

Here we show that SMG5 and SMG7 colocalize in cytoplasmic mRNA decay bodies, while SMG6 forms separate cytoplasmic foci. When SMG7 is tethered to a reporter transcript, it elicits its degradation, bypassing the requirement for a PTC, UPF1, SMG5, or SMG6. This activity is mediated by the C-terminal domain of SMG7. In contrast, SMG5 requires SMG7 to trigger mRNA decay and to localize to decay bodies. Our findings indicate that SMG7 provides a link between the NMD and the mRNA degradation machinery by interacting with SMG5 and UPF1 via its N-terminal domain and targeting bound transcripts for decay via its C-terminal domain.},

Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated.

abstract = {Background: Consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry is a fascinating problem in developmental and evolutionary biology. Conservation of early LR patterning steps among vertebrates as well as involvement of nonprotein small-molecule messengers are very poorly understood. Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neurotransmitter with crucial roles in physiology and cognition. We tested the hypothesis that LR patterning required prenervous serotonin signaling and characterized the 5-HT pathway in chick and frog embryos. Results: A pharmacological screen implicated endogenous signaling through receptors R3 and R4 and the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the establishment of correct sidedness of asymmetric gene expression and of the viscera in Xenopus embryos. HPLC and immunohistochemistry analysis indicates that Xenopus eggs contain a maternal supply of serotonin that is progressively degraded during cleavage stages. Serotonin's dynamic localization in frog embryos requires gap junctional communication and H,K-ATPase function. Microinjection of loss- and gain-of-function constructs into the right ventral blastomere randomizes asymmetry. In chick embryos, R3 and R4 activity is upstream of the asymmetry of Sonic hedgehog expression. MAO is asymmetrically expressed in the node. Conclusions: Serotonin is present in very early chick and frog embryos. 5-HT pathway function is required for normal asymmetry and is upstream of asymmetric gene expression. The microinjection data reveal asymmetry existing in frog embryos by the 4-cell stage and suggest novel intracellular 5-HT mechanisms. These functional and localization data identify a novel role for the neurotransmitter serotonin and implicate prenervous serotonergic signaling as an obligate aspect of very early left-right patterning conserved to two vertebrate species. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc enzymes acting as efficient catalysts for the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. 16 different alpha-CA isoforms were isolated in mammals, where they play crucial physiological roles. Some of them are cytosolic (CA I, CA II, CA III, CA VII, CA XIII), others are membrane-bound (CA IV, CA IX, CA XII, CA XIV and CA XV), CA VA and CA VB are mitochondrial, and CA VI is secreted in saliva and milk. Three acatalytic forms are also known, the CA related proteins (CARP), CARP VIII, CARP X and CARP XI. Representatives of the beta-delta-CA family are highly abundant in plants, diatoms, eubacteria and archaea. The catalytic mechanism of the alpha-CAs is understood in detail: the active site consists of a Zn(II) ion co-ordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule/hydroxide ion. The latter is the active species, acting as a potent nucleophile. For beta- and gamma-CAs, the zinc hydroxide mechanism is valid too, although at least some beta-class enzymes do not have water directly coordinated to the metal ion. CAs are inhibited primarily by two classes of compounds: the metal complexing anions and the sulfonamides/sulfamates/sulfamides possessing the general formula RXSO(2)NH(2) (R=aryl; hetaryl; perhaloalkyl; X=nothing, O or NH). Several important physiological and physio-pathological functions are played by CAs present in organisms all over the phylogenetic tree, related to respiration and transport of CO(2)/bicarbonate between metabolizing tissues and the lungs, pH and CO(2) homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a variety of tissues/organs, biosynthetic reactions, such as the gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis among others (in animals), CO(2) fixation (in plants and algae), etc. The presence of these ubiquitous enzymes in so many tissues and in so different isoforms represents an attractive goal for the design of inhibitors with biomedical applications. Indeed, CA inhibitors are clinically used as antiglaucoma drugs, some other compounds being developed as antitumour agents/diagnostic tools for tumours, antiobesity agents, anticonvulsants and antimicrobials/antifungals (inhibitors targeting alpha- or beta-CAs from pathogenic organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, Candida albicans, etc.).},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequorea victoria has been developed here as a reporter for gene expression and protein localization in Candida albicans. When wild-type (wt) GFP was expressed in C. albicans, it was not possible to detect fluorescence or a translation product for the wt protein. Since this was probably due in part to the presence of the non-canonical CTG serine codon in the Aequorea sequence, this codon was changed to the leucine codon TTG. C. albicans cells expressing this construct contained GFP mRNA but were non-fluorescent and contained no detectable translation product. Hence a codon-optimized GFP gene was constructed in which all of the 239 amino acids are encoded by optimal codons for C albicans. In this gene were also incorporated two previously identified mutations in the chromophore that increase GFP fluorescence. C. albicans cells expressing this yeast-enhanced GFP gene (yEGFP3) are fluorescent and contain GFP protein. yEGFP3 can be used as a versatile reporter of gene expression in C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the optimized GFP described here should have broad applications in these and other fungal species.},

The ‘core' mechanism underlying PCP signaling polarizes sheets of cells, aligning them in a head-to-tail fashion within the sheet. Cells use the resulting directional information to guide a wide variety of processes. One such process is lateralization, the determination of left–right asymmetry that guides the asymmetric morphology and placement of internal organs. Recent evidence extends the idea that PCP signaling underlies the earliest steps in lateralization and that PCP is invoked again during asymmetric morphogenesis of organs including the heart and gut.},

Several examples in the l i t e r a t{\~{}}r e{\~{}}*h{\~{}}a*ve{\~{}} shown that organelles are more likely ‘inherited' than formed de novo. During cellular evolution some eukaryotic organelles have developed out of primitive prokaryotic structures. Sub-cellular compartmentation led to a specialization in metabolic processes, which in turn can only occur when spatial separation exists. It has been the aim of biochemists and cell biologists for a long time to understand how eukaryotic organelles function, how they interact and communicate with each other, and how they are synthesized. A prerequisite to answer these questions is the isolation and biochemical characterization of organelles. For this reason, procedures of sub-cellular fractionation have been established for many types of cells. Based on rather primitive manipulations carried out at the beginning of research in this field, very sophisticated techniques have been developed to obtain highly enriched and purified organellar preparations. Mammalian cells were used in the past as representative of all eukaryotes, with the liver cell being the ‘standard cell'. More recently, yeast turned out to be a very useful model organism, because it can be easily manipulated by nutrients and the powerful methods of genetics and molecular biology. It is not surprising that this development had a major impact on the efforts of yeast cell biologists to improve techniques for the isolation of organelles of this unicellular lower eukaryote. The aim of this review is to give an overview of these methods, to compare them, and to point out advantages and disadvantages of the respective procedures. We will focus mainly on practical aspects of yeast organelle isolation, on standardized procedures and controls commonly used, and on the biochemical characterization of yeast sub-cellular fractions.

abstract = {Underlying acquired immunity to the fungus Candida albicans is usually present in adult immunocompetent individuals and is presumed to prevent mucosal colonization progressing to symptomatic infection. Exploration of immunological events leading to Candida resistance or susceptibility has indicated the central role of the innate and adaptive immune systems, the relative contribution of which may vary depending on the site of the primary infection. Nevertheless, acquired resistance to infection results from the development of Th1 responses. Cytokines produced by Th1 cells activate phagocytic cells to a candidacidal state. In contrast, cytokines produced by Th2 cells inhibit Th1 development and deactivate phagocytic effector cells. Because reciprocal influences have been recognized between innate and adaptive Th immunity, it appears that an integrated immune response determines the life-long commensalism of the fungus at the mucosal level, as well as the transition from mucosal saprophyte to pathogen.

abstract = {Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of mycosis-associated mortality in the United States. We examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable, at approximately 0.4 deaths per 100,000 population, since 1997, while mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant cause of IC, accounting for over half of all cases, but Candida glabrata has emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States, and several less common Candida species may be emerging, some of which can exhibit resistance to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades. Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized, including hand hygiene; appropriate use, placement, and care of central venous catheters; and prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal therapy are associated with increased mortality, improved use of early empirical, preemptive, and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However, improved non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive (or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with IC.},

Upon interaction with a protease, the serpin trap is sprung and the molecule continues to fold into a more stable conformation. However, thermodynamic stability can also be achieved through alternative, unproductive folding pathways that result in the formation of inactive conformations. Our increasing understanding of the mechanism of protease inhibition and the dynamics of native serpin structures has begun to reveal how evolution has harnessed the actual process of protein folding (rather than the final folded outcome) to elegantly achieve function.

C. parapsilosis infections are especially associated with hyperalimentation solutions, prosthetic devices, and indwelling catheters, as well as the nosocomial spread of disease through the hands of health care workers. Factors involved in disease pathogenesis include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion to prosthetics, and biofilm formation. New molecular genetic tools are providing additional and much-needed information regarding C. parapsilosis virulence. The emerging information will provide a deeper understanding of C. parapsilosis pathogenesis and facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating C. parapsilosis infections.},

abstract = {Vertebrate embryos develop distinct left-right asymmetry under the control of a conserved pathway involving left-sided deployment of the nodal and Pitx2 genes. The mechanism that initiates asymmetric expression of these genes is less clear, with cilia, ion flux, and signalling molecules all implicated. Vertebrates share the chordate phylum with urochordates such as the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis. We have explored the role of ion flux in regulating left-right asymmetry in Ciona, using an assay in which perturbation of left-sided Ci-Pitx expression provides a read-out for the disruption of asymmetry. Our data show that omeprazole, which specifically inhibits H +K+ATPase activity, disrupts asymmetry in Ciona. The vertebrate H+K+ATPase is composed of two subunits, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We identified one Ciona $\beta$ ortholog and two Ciona $\alpha$ orthologs of the vertebrate H+K+ATPase genes, and show that one of these is expressed in dorsal and ventral embryonic midline cells shortly before the activation of left-sided Ci-Pitx expression. Furthermore, we show that omeprazole exerts its effect on asymmetry at this point in development, and additionally implicate K+ channels in the regulation of asymmetry in Ciona. These experiments demonstrate a role for ion flux in the regulation of asymmetry in Ciona, and show a conserved, ancestral role for the H+K+ATPase ion pump in this process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Genetic analysis has identified the transcriptional activation of wg as one of the targets of hh activity: here we present evidence that transduction of the hh-encoded signal is mediated by the activity of four other segment polarity genes, patched, fused, costal-2 and cubitus interruptus. The results of our genetic epistatsis analysis together with the molecular structures of the products of these genes where known, suggest a pathway of interactions leading from reception of the hh-encoded signal at the cell membrane to transcriptional activation in the cell nucleus. We have also found that transcription of patched is regulated by the same pathway and describe the identification of cis-acting upstream elements of the ptc transcription unit that mediate this regulation.},

Formed biofilms are quantified by determining their metabolic activity and dry weight, whereas their gross morphology and architecture are evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy techniques. Susceptibility of biofilms is determined by comparing their metabolic activity in the presence of antifungal agents with that in their absence.

abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) represents a key mechanism to control the expression of wild-type and aberrant mRNAs. Phosphorylation of the protein UPF1 in the context of translation termination contributes to committing mRNAs to NMD. We report that translation termination is inhibited by UPF1 and stimulated by cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1). UPF1 binds to eRF1 and to the GTPase domain of eRF3 both in its GTP- and GDP-bound states. Importantly, mutation studies show that UPF1 can interact with the exon junction complex (EJC) alternatively through either UPF2 or UPF3b to become phosphorylated and to activate NMD. On this basis, we discuss an integrated model where UPF1 halts translation termination and is phosphorylated by SMG1 if the termination-promoting interaction of PABPC1 with eRF3 cannot readily occur. The EJC, with UPF2 or UPF3b as a cofactor, interferes with physiological termination through UPF1. This model integrates previously competing models of NMD and suggests a mechanistic basis for alternative NMD pathways. {\textcopyright} 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Discriminating between commensal and pathogenic states of opportunistic pathogens is critical for host mucosal defense and homeostasis. The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is also a constituent of the normal oral flora and grows either as yeasts or hyphae. We demonstrate that oral epithelial cells orchestrate an innate response to C. albicans via NF-$\kappa$B and a biphasic MAPK response. Activation of NF-$\kappa$B and the first MAPK phase, constituting c-Jun activation, is independent of morphology and due to fungal cell wall recognition. Activation of the second MAPK phase, constituting MKP1 and c-Fos activation, is dependent upon hypha formation and fungal burdens and correlates with proinflammatory responses. Such biphasic response may allow epithelial tissues to remain quiescent under low fungal burdens while responding specifically and strongly to damage-inducing hyphae when burdens increase. MAPK/MKP1/c-Fos activation may represent a "danger response" pathway that is critical for identifying and responding to the pathogenic switch of commensal microbes.},

abstract = {$\alpha$1-Antitrypsin deficiency is characterised by the misfolding and intracellular polymerisation of mutant $\alpha$1-antitrypsin within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The retention of mutant protein causes hepatic damage and cirrhosis whilst the lack of an important circulating protease inhibitor predisposes the individuals with severe $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency to early onset emphysema. Our work over the past 25 years has led to new paradigms for the liver and lung disease associated with $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency. We review here the molecular pathology of the cirrhosis and emphysema associated with $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency and show how an understanding of this condition provided the paradigm for a wider group of disorders that we have termed the serpinopathies. The detailed understanding of the pathobiology of $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency has identified important disease mechanisms to target. As a result, several novel parallel and complementary therapeutic approaches are in development with some now in clinical trials. We provide an overview of these new therapies for the liver and lung disease associated with $\alpha$1-antitrypsin deficiency.},

abstract = {We recently reported that spliceosomes alter messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) composition by depositing several proteins 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions. When assembled in vitro, this so-called 'exon-exon junction complex' (EJC) contains at least five proteins: SRm160, DEK, RNPS1, Y14 and REF. To better investigate its functional attributes, we now describe a method for generating spliced mRNAs both in vitro and in vivo that either do or do not carry the EJC. Analysis of these mRNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that this complex is the species responsible for enhancing nucleocytoplasmic export of spliced mRNAs. It does so by providing a strong binding site for the mRNA export factors REF and TAP/p15. Moreover, by serving as an anchoring point for the factors Upf2 and Upf3, the EJC provides a direct link between splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Finally, we show that the composition of the EJC is dynamic in vivo and is subject to significant evolution upon mRNA export to the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {Protein-lipid interactions are a key element of the function of many integral membrane proteins. These potential interactions should be considered alongside the complexity and diversity of membrane lipid composition. Inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir) Kir2.2 has multiple interactions with plasma membrane lipids: Phosphatidylinositol (4, 5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) activates the channel; a secondary anionic lipid site has been identified, which augments the activation by PIP2; and cholesterol inhibits the channel. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to characterize in molecular detail the protein-lipid interactions of Kir2.2 in a model of the complex plasma membrane. Kir2.2 has been simulated with multiple, functionally important lipid species. From our simulations we show that PIP2 interacts most tightly at the crystallographic interaction sites, outcompeting other lipid species at this site. Phosphatidylserine (PS) interacts at the previously identified secondary anionic lipid interaction site, in a PIP2 concentration-dependent manner. There is interplay between these anionic lipids: PS interactions are diminished when PIP2 is not present in the membrane, underlining the need to consider multiple lipid species when investigating protein-lipid interactions.},

abstract = {The engineering of genetic circuits with predictive functionality in living cells represents a defining focus of the expanding field of synthetic biology. This focus was elegantly set in motion a decade ago with the design and construction of a genetic toggle switch and an oscillator, with subsequent highlights that have included circuits capable of pattern generation, noise shaping, edge detection and event counting. Here we describe an engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells. Using microfluidic devices tailored for cellular populations at differing length scales, we investigate the collective synchronization properties along with spatiotemporal waves occurring at millimetre scales. We use computational modelling to describe quantitatively the observed dependence of the period and amplitude of the bulk oscillations on the flow rate. The synchronized genetic clock sets the stage for the use of microbes in the creation of a macroscopic biosensor with an oscillatory output. Furthermore, it provides a specific model system for the generation of a mechanistic description of emergent coordinated behaviour at the colony level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: In Xenopus embryos, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and secreted inhibitors of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated signalling have been implicated in neural induction. The precise roles, if any, that these factors play in neural induction in amniotes remains to be established. Results: To monitor the initial steps of neural induction in the chick embryo, we developed an in vitro assay of neural differentiation in epiblast cells. Using this assay, we found evidence that neural cell fate is specified in utero, before the generation of the primitive streak or Hensen's node. Early epiblast cells expressed both Bmp4 and Bmp7, but the expression of both genes was downregulated as cells acquired neural fate. During prestreak and gastrula stages, exposure of epiblast cells to BMP4 activity in vitro was sufficient to block the acquisition of neural fate and to promote the generation of epidermal cells. Fgf3 was also found to be expressed in the early epiblast, and ongoing FGF signalling in epiblast cells was required for acquisition of neural fate and for the suppression of Bmp4 and Bmp7 expression. Conclusions: The onset of neural differentiation in the chick embryo occurs in utero, before the generation of Hensen's node. Fgf3, Brnp4 and Bmp7 are each expressed in prospective neural cells, and FGF signalling appears to be required for the repression of Bmp expression and for the acquisition of neural fate. Subsequent exposure of epiblast cells to BMPs, however, can prevent the generation of neural tissue and induce cells of epidermal character.},

Receptor stimuli that hydrolyze PIP2 lowered adhesion energy, a process that could be mimicked by expressing PH domains that sequester PIP2 or by targeting a 5'-PIP2- phosphatase to the plasma membrane to selectively lower plasma membrane PIP2 concentration. Our study suggests that plasma membrane PIP2 controls dynamic membrane functions and cell shape by locally increasing and decreasing the adhesion between the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is among the most important gases for all organisms. Its reversible interconversion to bicarbonate (HCO(3) (-)) reaches equilibrium spontaneously, but slowly, and can be accelerated by a ubiquitous group of enzymes called carbonic anhydrases (CAs). These enzymes are grouped by their distinct structural features into alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta- and zeta-classes. While physiological functions of mammalian, prokaryotic, plant and algal CAs have been extensively studied over the past years, the role of beta-CAs in yeasts and the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans has been elucidated only recently, and the function of CAs in multicellular filamentous ascomycetes is mostly unknown. To assess the role of CAs in the development of filamentous ascomycetes, the function of three genes, cas1, cas2 and cas3 (carbonic anhydrase of Sordaria) encoding beta-class carbonic anhydrases was characterized in the filamentous ascomycetous fungus Sordaria macrospora. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the localization of GFP- and DsRED-tagged CAs. While CAS1 and CAS3 are cytoplasmic enzymes, CAS2 is localized to the mitochondria. To assess the function of the three isoenzymes, we generated knock-out strains for all three cas genes (Deltacas1, Deltacas2, and Deltacas3) as well as all combinations of double mutants. No effect on vegetative growth, fruiting-body and ascospore development was seen in the single mutant strains lacking cas1 or cas3, while single mutant Deltacas2 was affected in vegetative growth, fruiting-body development and ascospore germination, and the double mutant strain Deltacas1/2 was completely sterile. Defects caused by the lack of cas2 could be partially complemented by elevated CO(2) levels or overexpression of cas1, cas3, or a non-mitochondrial cas2 variant. The results suggest that CAs are required for sexual reproduction in filamentous ascomycetes and that the multiplicity of isoforms results in redundancy of specific and non-specific functions.},

abstract = {Haploinsufficiency of Retinoic Acid Induced 1 (RAI1) causes Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), which is associated with diverse neurodevelopmental and behavioral symptoms as well as obesity. RAI1 encodes a nuclear protein but little is known about its molecular function or the cell types responsible for SMS symptoms. Using genetically engineered mice, we found that Rai1 preferentially occupies DNA regions near active promoters and promotes the expression of a group of genes involved in circuit assembly and neuronal communication. Behavioral analyses demonstrated that pan-neural loss of Rai1 causes deficits in motor function, learning, and food intake. These SMS-like phenotypes are produced by loss of Rai1 function in distinct neuronal types: Rai1 loss in inhibitory neurons or subcortical glutamatergic neurons causes learning deficits, while Rai1 loss in Sim1+ or SF1+ cells causes obesity. By integrating molecular and organismal analyses, our study suggests potential therapeutic avenues for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.},

abstract = {DNA supercoiling is an inherent consequence of twisting DNA and is critical for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. However, DNA supercoiling at a genomic scale in human cells is uncharacterized. To map supercoiling, we used biotinylated trimethylpsoralen as a DNA structure probe to show that the human genome is organized into supercoiling domains. Domains are formed and remodeled by RNA polymerase and topoisomerase activities and are flanked by GC-AT boundaries and CTCF insulator protein-binding sites. Underwound domains are transcriptionally active and enriched in topoisomerase I, 'open' chromatin fibers and DNase I sites, but they are depleted of topoisomerase II. Furthermore, DNA supercoiling affects additional levels of chromatin compaction as underwound domains are cytologically decondensed, topologically constrained and decompacted by transcription of short RNAs. We suggest that supercoiling domains create a topological environment that facilitates gene activation, providing an evolutionary purpose for clustering genes along chromosomes.

abstract = {Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyses the rapid interconversion between CO(2) and HCO(3) (-). Despite its wide distribution among living organisms, the presence of CA in fungi has been controversially discussed. Using mass spectrometric analysis of (18)O exchange from doubly labelled CO(2), we were able to measure CA activity in intact cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intracellular CA activity was lacking in the Deltance103 mutant, indicating that NCE103 encodes a functional CA. This was proven by overexpressing and purification of the NCE103 gene product showing a specific activity of around 6900 units per mg protein. Interestingly, the in vivo CA activity was 10-20 times higher in cells grown on low inorganic carbon (Ci; air containing 0.035{\%} CO(2)) than in high-Ci cells (grown on 5{\%} CO(2)). The enhanced CA activity of low-Ci cells was inducible after transferring high-Ci cells to air. Northern blot analysis revealed that that expression of NCE103 is transcriptionally regulated by low Ci which was also demonstrated by fusing the NCE103 promoter to beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene. Inactivation of NCE103 results in a high CO(2) requiring mutant indicating that a functional CA is an important prerequisite for S. cerevisiae to grow under low-Ci conditions.},

Cytokines produced by Th1 cells activate macrophages and neutrophils to a candidacidal state. The development of Th2 responses underlines susceptibility to infection, because cytokines produced by Th2 cells inhibit Th1 development and deactivate phagocytic effector cells. With the recognition of the reciprocal influences between innate and adaptive Th immunity, it appears that the coordinated action of these two lines of immune defense is required to efficiently oppose the infectivity of the fungus and to determine its lifelong commensalism at the mucosal level.},

C. albicans is the most frequent species, but considerable differences are found between the number of cases caused by C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis. Studies from Northern Europe and the USA reported a high number of cases caused by C. glabrata, whereas studies from Spain and Brazil demonstrated a lower number of cases caused by C. glabrata and a higher number of cases attributed to C. parapsilosis. Globally, the frequency of C. albicans is decreasing, while that of C. glabrata and C. krusei is stable, and C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis are increasing. Patient characteristics and prior antifungal therapy also have a considerable influence on the distribution and frequency of Candida spp., regardless of the geographical area. C. albicans is more frequent in patients aged up to 18 years, the frequency of C. parapsilosis decreases with age, and C. glabrata is more common in the elderly. Finally, the presence of horizontal transmission of Candida spp. isolates (reported mainly in patients from the adult medical and post-surgical ICU, patients from oncology-haematology units, and neonates) can affect species distribution.},

The database was created and has been continuously updated by the TMDET algorithm that is able to distinguish between transmembrane and non-transmembrane proteins using their 3D atomic coordinates only. The TMDET algorithm can locate the spatial positions of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayer as well. During the last 8 years not only the size of the PDBTM database has been steadily growing from ∼400 to 1700 entries but also new structural elements have been identified, in addition to the well-known $\alpha$-helical bundle and $\beta$-barrel structures. Numerous 'exotic' transmembrane protein structures have been solved since the first release, which has made it necessary to define these new structural elements, such as membrane loops or interfacial helices in the database. This article reports the new features of the PDBTM database that have been added since its first release, and our current efforts to keep the database up-to-date and easy to use so that it may continue to serve as a fundamental resource for the scientific community. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Neoplasms change over time through a process of cell-level evolution, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. However, the ecology of the microenvironment of a neoplastic cell determines which changes provide adaptive benefits. There is widespread recognition of the importance of these evolutionary and ecological processes in cancer, but to date, no system has been proposed for drawing clinically relevant distinctions between how different tumours are evolving. On the basis of a consensus conference of experts in the fields of cancer evolution and cancer ecology, we propose a framework for classifying tumours that is based on four relevant components. These are the diversity of neoplastic cells (intratumoural heterogeneity) and changes over time in that diversity, which make up an evolutionary index (Evo-index), as well as the hazards to neoplastic cell survival and the resources available to neoplastic cells, which make up an ecological index (Eco-index). We review evidence demonstrating the importance of each of these factors and describe multiple methods that can be used to measure them. Development of this classification system holds promise for enabling clinicians to personalize optimal interventions based on the evolvability of the patient's tumour. The Evo-A nd Eco-indices provide a common lexicon for communicating about how neoplasms change in response to interventions, with potential implications for clinical trials, personalized medicine and basic cancer research.},

abstract = {The frequency distribution of characterstates of morphologic variables in the house sparrows collected after a severe winter storm in Providence, R. I., in February, 1898, by Hermon C. Bumpus are such that they adequately generate the following hypotheses: 1) large males have a selective advantage over small ones under conditions of severe winter cold stress; 2) females of intermediate size have a selective advantage over larger and smaller individuals under conditions of severe winter cold stress; 3) small subadult (= first year) males are at a selective disadvantage relative to small adult males under severe winter cold stress. Surviving individuals showed normal secondary sexual size dimorphism, but nonsurvivors were almost monomorphic for size of skeletal characters. Many nonsurviving females tended to have male-like proportions and nonsurviving males tended to have female-like proportions; thus, differential storm-induced survival suggests there are viability components of fitness in sizes of the sexes in addition to the reproductive components of fitness that have been invoked to explain general size dimorphism in sparrows.},

abstract = {The concept of the nuclear matrix, a karyoskeletal structure that serves as a support for the genome and its activities, has stimulated many studies of the association of nuclear components and functions with this structure. However, certain experimental findings are not consistent with the existence of the nuclear matrix in vivo, including our inability to visualise a corresponding structure in intact cells, the demonstrated mobility in vivo of chromatin and messenger ribonucleoprotein particles, which are claimed to be bound to the nuclear matrix, the paradoxical extractability from nuclei in low ionic strength buffers of enzymes that are found in the 2 M NaCl-insoluble matrix, and the extractability, in conditions which reproduce the intranuclear milieu, of regions of DNA (matrix or scaffold attachment regions, MAR/SARs) postulated to be bound to the nuclear matrix in vivo. This review considers the nuclear matrix model in the light of sometimes overlooked evidence that each step in its isolation may cause nuclear components to bind to it by new liaisons that do not exist in vivo. This is illustrated by experiments where nuclear-targeted green fluorescent protein is found in the nuclear matrix, and raises the possibility that MAR/SARs actually bind to DNA-binding proteins or multiprotein complexes, including replicational, transcriptional and processing machinery, and topoisomerases that are incorporated into the nuclear matrix during its preparation. Considering that the nuclear lamina forms a rigid exoskeleton, the necessity for internal skeletal structures is raised; the major roles that macromolecular crowding, phase partitioning, and charge effects are likely to play in organisation of the intranuclear space may provide new models for the compartmentalisation of proteins and functions into different nuclear domains and of chromosomes into territories.},

C. parapsilosis infections are especially associated with hyperalimentation solutions, prosthetic devices, and indwelling catheters, as well as the nosocomial spread of disease through the hands of health care workers. Factors involved in disease pathogenesis include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion to prosthetics, and biofilm formation. New molecular genetic tools are providing additional and much-needed information regarding C. parapsilosis virulence. The emerging information will provide a deeper understanding of C. parapsilosis pathogenesis and facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating C. parapsilosis infections.},

It is unclear if this is a conserved mechanism among other vertebrates and how the directionality of the flow arises from the motion of cilia. In this paper, we show that rabbit and medakafish embryos also exhibit a leftward fluid flow in their ventral nodes. In all cases, primary monocilia present a clockwise rotational-like motion. Observations of defective ciliary dynamics in mutant mouse embryos support the idea that the posterior tilt of the cilia during rotational-like beating can explain the leftward fluid flow. Moreover, we show that this leftward flow may produce asymmetric distribution of exogenously introduced proteins, suggesting morphogen gradients as a subsequent mechanism of left-right axis determination. Finally, we experimentally and theoretically characterize under which conditions a morphogen gradient can arise from the flow. Copyright {\textcopyright}2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

In the present study, oral epithelial cells collected from saliva of healthy volunteers and a purified oral epithelial cell line were found to inhibit blastoconidia and/or hyphal growth of several Candida species. Cell contact was a strict requirement for the epithelial cell anti-Candida activity; neither saliva nor culture supernatants alone inhibited Candida growth, and addition of saliva to the coculture did not modulate the epithelial cell activity. Finally, epithelial cell anti-Candida activity was significantly lower in HIV-infected persons with OPC. Together, these results suggest that oral epithelial cells may play a role in innate resistance against OPC.},

abstract = {A cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluid breaks bilateral symmetry in the dorsal midline of the neurula stage vertebrate embryo. The left-specific Nodal signaling cascade in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is key to asymmetric morphogenesis and placement of organs during subsequent development. The nature of the initial asymmetric cue(s) as well as the transfer of information from the midline to the left side has remained elusive. Gap junctional communication has been previously involved in Xenopus left-right (LR) development, however a function at cleavage stages was inferred from inhibitor experiments. Here we show by heptanol-mediated block of connexin function that flow stages during neurulation represent the critical time window. Flow in Xenopus occurs at the gastrocoel roof plate (GRP), a ciliated sheath of cells of mesodermal fate transiently positioned within the dorsal epithelial lining of the forming archenteron. We reasoned that endodermal cells immediately adjacent to the GRP are important for transfer of asymmetry. A systematic screen identified two connexin genes, Cx26 and Cx32, which were co-expressed in these lateral endodermal cells. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments pinpointed Cx26 as the critical connexin for LR development, while Cx32 had no effect on laterality. Importantly, GRP morphology, ciliation and flow were not affected in Cx26 morphants. Our results demonstrate a decisive role of Cx26 in the transfer of laterality cues from the GRP to the left LPM, providing a novel access to the identification of the initial asymmetric signal generated by flow.},

abstract = {Clonal diversity is a consequence of cancer cell evolution driven by Darwinian selection. Precise characterization of clonal architecture is essential to understand the evolutionary history of tumor development and its association with treatment resistance. Here, using a single-cell DNA sequencing, we report the clonal architecture and mutational histories of 123 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The single-cell data reveals cell-level mutation co-occurrence and enables reconstruction of mutational histories characterized by linear and branching patterns of clonal evolution, with the latter including convergent evolution. Through xenotransplantion, we show leukemia initiating capabilities of individual subclones evolving in parallel. Also, by simultaneous single-cell DNA and cell surface protein analysis, we illustrate both genetic and phenotypic evolution in AML. Lastly, single-cell analysis of longitudinal samples reveals underlying evolutionary process of therapeutic resistance. Together, these data unravel clonal diversity and evolution patterns of AML, and highlight their clinical relevance in the era of precision medicine.},

Despite a strong protective role for cell-mediated immunity (CMI) against other mucosal candidal infections, numerous studies in humans and most animal models have revealed little to no role for CMI or other forms of acquired immunity against vaginal candidal infections. Studies suggest that this may be because of immunoregulatory mechanisms that inhibit more profound adaptive immune responses rather than the simple lack of responsiveness. Such regulatory mechanisms significantly influence the pathogenesis of Candida vaginitis.},

abstract = {Sterol biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an energy-expensive, aerobic process, requiring heme and molecular oxygen. Heme, also synthesized exclusively during aerobic growth, not only acts as an enzymatic cofactor but also is directly and indirectly responsible for the transcriptional control of several yeast genes. Because of their biosynthetic similarities, we hypothesized that ergosterol, like heme, may have a regulatory function. Sterols are known to play a structural role in membrane integrity, but regulatory roles have not been characterized. To test possible regulatory roles of sterol, the promoter for the ERG3 gene, encoding the sterol C-5 desaturase, was fused to the bacterial lacZ reporter gene. This construct was placed in strains making aberrant sterols, and the effect of altered sterol composition on gene expression was monitored by beta-galactosidase activity. The absence of ergosterol resulted in a 35-fold increase in the expression of ERG3 as measured by beta-galactosidase activity. The level of ERG3 mRNA was increased as much as ninefold in erg mutant strains or wild-type strains inhibited in ergosterol biosynthesis by antifungal agents. The observed regulatory effects of ergosterol on ERG3 are specific for ergosterol, as several ergosterol derivatives failed to elicit the same controlling effect. These results demonstrate for the first time that ergosterol exerts a regulatory effect on gene transcription in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway detects aberrant transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) and regulates expression of 5–10{\%} of non-aberrant human mRNAs. To date, most proteins involved in NMD have been identified by genetic screens in model organisms; however, the increased complexity of gene expression regulation in human cells suggests that additional proteins may participate in the human NMD pathway. To identify proteins required for NMD, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen against {\textgreater}21,000 genes. Canonical members of the NMD pathway were highly enriched as top hits in the siRNA screen, along with numerous candidate NMD factors, including the conserved ICE1/KIAA0947 protein. RNAseq studies reveal that depletion of ICE1 globally enhances accumulation and stability of NMD-target mRNAs. Further, our data suggest that ICE1 uses a putative MIF4G domain to interact with exon junction complex (EJC) proteins and promotes the association of the NMD protein UPF3B with the EJC.},

CAs have been identified in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and can be classified into five groups ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\zeta$) that are unrelated in sequence and structure. The fungal $\beta$-class has only recently attracted attention. In the present study, we investigated the structure and function of the plant-like $\beta$-CA proteins CAS1 and CAS2 from the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora. We demonstrated that both proteins can substitute for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae $\beta$-CA Nce103 and exhibit an in vitro CO2 hydration activity (kcat /Km of CAS1: 1.30 × 10(6)  m(-1) {\textperiodcentered}s(-1) ; CAS2: 1.21 × 10(6 ) m(-1) {\textperiodcentered}s(-1) ). To further investigate the structural properties of CAS1 and CAS2, we determined their crystal structures to a resolution of 2.7 {\AA} and 1.8 {\AA}, respectively. The oligomeric state of both proteins is tetrameric. With the exception of the active site composition, no further major differences have been found. In both enzymes, the Zn(2) (+)  -ion is tetrahedrally coordinated; in CAS1 by Cys45, His101 and Cys104 and a water molecule and in CAS2 by the side chains of four residues (Cys56, His112, Cys115 and Asp58).

abstract = {Higher-order chromatin structural domains approximately 130 nm in width are observed as prominent components of both Drosophila melanogaster and human mitotic chromosomes using buffer conditions which preserve chromosome morphology as determined by light microscopic comparison with chromosomes within living cells. Spatially discrete chromatin structural domains of similar size also exist as prominent components within interphase nuclei prepared under equivalent conditions. Examination of chromosomes during the anaphase-telophase transition suggests that chromosomes decondense largely through the progressive straightening or uncoiling of these large-scale chromatin domains. A quantitative analysis of the size distribution of these higher-order domains in telophase nuclei indicated a mean width of 126±36 nm. Three-dimensional views using stereopairs of chromosomes and interphase nuclei from 0.5 $\mu$m thick sections suggest that these large-scale chromatin domains consist of 30 nm fibers packed by tight folding into larger, linear, fiber-like elements. Reduction in vitro of either polyamine or divalent cation concentrations within two different buffer systems results in a loss of these large-scale domains, with no higher-order chromatin organization evident above the 20-30 nm fiber. Under these conditions the DNA distribution within mitotic chromosomes and interphase nuclei appears significantly diffuse relative to the appearance by light microscopy within living cells, or, by electron microscopy, within cells fixed directly without permeabilization in buffer. These results suggest that these large-scale chromatin structural domains are fundamental elements of chromosome architecture in vivo. {\textcopyright} 1989 Springer-Verlag.},

Individuals at the highest risk for severe infection include neonates and patients in intensive care units. C. parapsilosis infections are especially associated with hyperalimentation solutions, prosthetic devices, and indwelling catheters, as well as the nosocomial spread of disease through the hands of health care workers. Factors involved in disease pathogenesis include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion to prosthetics, and biofilm formation. New molecular genetic tools are providing additional and much-needed information regarding C. parapsilosis virulence. The emerging information will provide a deeper understanding of C. parapsilosis pathogenesis and facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating C. parapsilosis infections.},

abstract = {We undertook clinical evaluation (32 cases) and molecular evaluation (31 cases) of unrelated patients affected with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) associated with an interstitial deletion of band p11.2 of chromosome 17. Patients were evaluated both clinically and electrophysiologically for peripheral neuropathy, since markers showing close linkage to one form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT1A) map to this chromosomal region. The common clinical findings were broad flat midface with brachycephaly, broad nasal bridge, brachydactyly, speech delay, and hoarse, deep voice. Fifty-five percent of the patients showed clinical signs (e.g., decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, pes planus or pes cavus, decreased sensitivity to pain, and decreased leg muscle mass) suggestive of peripheral neuropathy. However, unlike patients with CMT1A, these patients demonstrated normal nerve conduction velocities. Self-destructive behaviors, primarily onychotillomania and polyembolokoilamania, were observed in 67{\%} of the patients, and significant symptoms of sleep disturbance were observed in 62{\%}. The absence of REM sleep was demonstrated by polysomnography in two patients. Southern analysis indicated that most patients were deleted for five 17p11.2 markers--FG1 (D17S446), 1516 (D17S258), pYNM67-R5 (D17S29), pA10-41 (D17S71), and pS6.1-HB2 (D17S445)--thus defining a region which appears to be critical to SMS. The deletion was determined to be of paternal origin in nine patients and of maternal origin in six patients. The apparent random parental origin of deletion documented in 15 patients suggests that genomic imprinting does not play a role in the expression of the SMS clinical phenotype. Our findings suggest that SMS is likely a contiguous-gene deletion syndrome which comprises characteristic clinical features, developmental delay, clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy, abnormal sleep function, and specific behavioral anomalies.},

Both the toxicity of filipin and the therapeutic value of amphotericin B can be rationalized at the cellular and molecular level by the following observations: (i) these polyene antibiotics showed differential effects on cells; filipin was more potent in lysing human red blood cells, whereas amphotericin B was more potent in inhibiting yeast cell growth; and (ii) the effects of filipin were more efficiently inhibited by added cholesterol, the major membrane sterol in human cells, whereas the effects of amphotericin B were more efficiently inhibited by ergosterol, the major membrane sterol in yeast. The simplest inference is that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyenes are determined by their relative avidities for the predominant sterol in cell membranes.},

While the majority of SMS cases harbor an {\~{}}3.5 Mb common deletion on 17p11.2 that encompasses the retinoic acid induced-1 (RAI1) gene, some patients carry small intragenic deletions or point mutations in RAI1. We present data on two cases of Smith-Magenis syndrome with mutation of RAI1. Both cases are phenotypically consistent with SMS and RAI1 mutation but also have other anomalies not previously reported in SMS, including spontaneous pneumothoraces. These cases also illustrate variability in the SMS phenotype not previously shown for RAI1 mutation cases, including hearing loss, absence of self-abusive behaviours, and mild global delays. Sequencing of RAI1 revealed mutation of the same heptameric C-tract (CCCCCCC) in exon 3 in both cases (c.3103delC one case and and c.3103insC in the other), resulting in frameshift mutations. Of the seven reported frameshift mutations occurring in poly C-tracts in RAI1, four cases ({\~{}}57{\%}) occur at this heptameric C-tract. Collectively, these results indicate that this heptameric C-tract is a preferential hotspot for single nucleotide insertion/deletions (SNindels) and therefore, should be considered a primary target for analysis in patients suspected for mutations in RAI1. We expect that as more patients are sequenced for mutations in RAI1, the incidence of frameshift mutations in this hotspot will become more evident.},

abstract = {The neurotransmitter serotonin has been shown to regulate a number of embryonic patterning events in addition to its crucial role in the nervous system. Here, we examine the role of two serotonin transporters, the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), in embryonic left-right asymmetry. Pharmacological or genetic inhibitors of either SERT or VMAT specifically randomized the laterality of the heart and viscera in Xenopus embryos. This effect takes place during cleavage stages, and is upstream of the left-sided gene XNR-1. Targeted microinjection of an SERT-dominant negative construct confirmed the necessity for SERT function in embryonic laterality and revealed that the descendants of the right ventral blastomere are the most dependant upon SERT signaling in left-right patterning. Moreover, the importance of SERT and VMAT in laterality is conserved in chick embryos, being upstream of the early left-sided gene Shh. Endogenous transcripts of SERT and VMAT are expressed from the initiation of the primitive streak in chick and are asymmetrically expressed in Hensen's node. Taken together our data characterize two new right-sided markers in chick gastrulation, identify a novel, early component of the left-right pathway in two vertebrate species, and reveal a new biological role for serotonin transport.

abstract = {A surprisingly small number of signalling pathways generate a plethora of cellular responses ranging from the acquisition of multiple cell fates to proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell death. These diverse responses may be due to the dose-dependent activities of signalling factors, or to intrinsic differences in the response of cells to a given signal-a phenomenon called differential cellular competence. In this review, we focus on temporal and spatial differences in competence for Hedgehog (HH) signalling, a signalling pathway that is reiteratively employed in embryos and adult organisms. We discuss the upstream signals and mechanisms that may establish differential competence for HHs in a range of different tissues. We argue that the changing competence for HH signalling provides a four-dimensional framework for the interpretation of the signal that is essential for the emergence of functional anatomy. A number of diseases-including several types of cancer-are caused by malfunctions of the HH pathway. A better understanding of what provides differential competence for this signal may reveal HH-related disease mechanisms and equip us with more specific tools to manipulate HH signalling in the clinic.},

abstract = {TAC1 (for transcriptional activator of CDR genes) is critical for the upregulation of the ABC transporters CDR1 and CDR2, which mediate azole resistance in Candida albicans. While a wild-type TAC1 allele drives high expression of CDR1/2 in response to inducers, we showed previously that TAC1 can be hyperactive by a gain-of-function (GOF) point mutation responsible for constitutive high expression of CDR1/2. High azole resistance levels are achieved when C. albicans carries hyperactive alleles only as a consequence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TAC1 locus on chromosome 5 (Chr 5), which is linked to the mating-type-like (MTL) locus. Both are located on the Chr 5 left arm along with ERG11 (target of azoles). In this work, five groups of related isolates containing azole-susceptible and -resistant strains were analyzed for the TAC1 and ERG11 alleles and for Chr 5 alterations. While recovered ERG11 alleles contained known mutations, 17 new TAC1 alleles were isolated, including 7 hyperactive alleles with five separate new GOF mutations. Single-nucleotide-polymorphism analysis of Chr 5 revealed that azole-resistant strains acquired TAC1 hyperactive alleles and, in most cases, ERG11 mutant alleles by LOH events not systematically including the MTL locus. TAC1 LOH resulted from mitotic recombination of the left arm of Chr 5, gene conversion within the TAC1 locus, or the loss and reduplication of the entire Chr 5. In one case, two independent TAC1 hyperactive alleles were acquired. Comparative genome hybridization and karyotype analysis revealed the presence of isochromosome 5L [i(5L)] in two azole-resistant strains. i(5L) leads to increased copy numbers of azole resistance genes present on the left arm of Chr 5, among them TAC1 and ERG11. Our work shows that azole resistance was due not only to the presence of specific mutations in azole resistance genes (at least ERG11 and TAC1) but also to their increase in copy number by LOH and to the addition of extra Chr 5 copies. With the combination of these different modifications, sophisticated genotypes were obtained. The development of azole resistance in C. albicans is therefore a powerful instrument for generating genetic diversity.},

abstract = {The establishment of left-right body asymmetry is a key biological process that is tightly regulated genetically. In the first application of CRISPR/Cas9 to a mollusc, we show decisively that the actinrelated diaphanous gene Lsdia1 is the single maternal gene that determines the shell coiling direction of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Biallelic frameshift mutations of the gene produced sinistrally coiled offspring generation after generation, in the otherwise totally dextral genetic background. This is the gene sought for over a century. We also show that the gene sets the chirality at the one-cell stage, the earliest observed symmetrybreaking event linked directly to body handedness in the animal kingdom. The early intracellular chirality is superseded by the intercellular chirality during the 3rd cleavage, leading to asymmetric nodal and Pitx expression, and then to organismal body handedness. Thus, our findings have important implications for chiromorphogenesis in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, including humans, and for the evolution of snail chirality.

One focal point of adaptive divergence occurs in the context of diet and metabolism, and males and females of a range of species have been shown to require different nutrients to maximize their fitness. Biochemical analyses in Drosophila melanogaster have confirmed that dimorphism in dietary requirements is associated with molecular sex differences in metabolite titres. In addition, they also showed significant within-sex genetic variation in the metabolome. To date however, it is unknown whether this metabolic variation translates into differences in reproductive fitness. The answer to this question is crucial to establish whether genetic variation is selectively neutral or indicative of constraints on sex-specific physiological adaptation and optimization. Here we assay genetic variation in consumption and metabolic fitness effects by screening male and female fitness of thirty D. melanogaster genotypes across four protein-to-carbohydrate ratios. In addition to confirming sexual dimorphism in consumption and fitness, we find significant genetic variation in male and female dietary requirements. Importantly, these differences are not explained by feeding responses and probably reflect metabolic variation that, in turn, suggests the presence of genetic constraints on metabolic dimorphism.},

Leftward flow of extracellular fluid at the node (nodal flow) is critical for normal LR axis determination in the mouse. Nodal flow is generated by motile node cell monocilia and requires the axonemal dynein, left-right dynein (lrd). In the absence of lrd, LR determination becomes random. The cation channel polycystin-2 is also required to establish LR asymmetry. We show that lrd localizes to a centrally located subset of node monocilia, while polycystin-2 is found in all node monocilia. Asymmetric calcium signaling appears at the left margin of the node coincident with nodal flow. These observations suggest that LR asymmetry is established by an entirely ciliary mechanism: motile, lrd-containing monocilia generate nodal flow, and nonmotile polycystin-2 containing cilia sense nodal flow initiating an asymmetric calcium signal at the left border of the node.},

Despite its wide distribution among living organisms, the presence of CA in fungi has been controversially discussed. Using mass spectrometric analysis of (18)O exchange from doubly labelled CO(2), we were able to measure CA activity in intact cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Intracellular CA activity was lacking in the Deltance103 mutant, indicating that NCE103 encodes a functional CA. This was proven by overexpressing and purification of the NCE103 gene product showing a specific activity of around 6900 units per mg protein. Interestingly, the in vivo CA activity was 10-20 times higher in cells grown on low inorganic carbon (Ci; air containing 0.035{\%} CO(2)) than in high-Ci cells (grown on 5{\%} CO(2)). The enhanced CA activity of low-Ci cells was inducible after transferring high-Ci cells to air. Northern blot analysis revealed that that expression of NCE103 is transcriptionally regulated by low Ci which was also demonstrated by fusing the NCE103 promoter to beta-galactosidase as a reporter gene. Inactivation of NCE103 results in a high CO(2) requiring mutant indicating that a functional CA is an important prerequisite for S. cerevisiae to grow under low-Ci conditions.},

These effects were seen unequivocally in HIV-infected patients with oropharyngeal candida infections, but their incidence has decreased dramatically with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. The evidence for similar emergence of antifungal-resistant yeast strains and species in other types of candida infections is confounded by non-standardised susceptibility testing methods and definitions of a resistant fungal isolate. Recent large-scale surveys of yeasts isolated from blood cultures, based on standardised methodology and resistance definitions, do not support the view that antifungal resistance in pathogenic yeasts constitutes a significant or growing therapeutic problem.},

As a result, fitness can be maximized only when animals are able to direct their attention to foods that reflect their current nutritional needs. Despite significant literature documenting the fitness consequences of nutrient composition and preference, less is known about the underlying genetic architecture of the dietary preferences themselves, specifically, the degree to which they can respond to selection. We addressed this by integrating evolutionary quantitative genetics and nutritional geometry to examine the shape of the sex-specific fitness surfaces and the availability of genetic variance for macronutrient preferences in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Combining these analyses, we found that the microevolutionary potential of carbohydrate and protein preference was above average in this population, because the expected direction of selection was relatively well aligned with the major axis of the genetic variance-covariance matrix, G.We also found that potential exists for sexually antagonistic genetic constraint in this system; macronutrient blends maximizing fitness differed between the sexes, and cross-sex genetic correlations for their consumption were positive. However, both sexes were displaced from their feeding optima, generating similar directional selection on males and females, with the combined effect being that minimal sex-specific genetic constraints currently affect dietary preferences in this population. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

After gastrulation, a second wave of Nodal signaling breaks the symmetry between the left and right sides of the embryo. During these processes, elaborate regulatory feedback between TGF-$\beta$ ligands and their antagonists direct the proper specification and patterning of embryonic tissues. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the function and regulation of TGF-$\beta$ family signaling in these processes.

A stable matrix underpinning nuclear organization was hypothesized, but the idea was abandoned as more dynamic models of chromatin behavior became prevalent. Here, we report that scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A), originally identified as a structural nuclear protein, interacts with chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) via its RGG domain to regulate human interphase chromatin structures in a transcription-dependent manner. Mechanistically, this is dependent on SAF-A's AAA+ ATPase domain, which mediates cycles of protein oligomerization with caRNAs, in response to ATP binding and hydrolysis. SAF-A oligomerization decompacts large-scale chromatin structure while SAF-A loss or monomerization promotes aberrant chromosome folding and accumulation of genome damage. Our results show that SAF-A and caRNAs form a dynamic, transcriptionally responsive chromatin mesh that organizes large-scale chromosome structures and protects the genome from instability.},

abstract = {Clinical needs for novel antifungal agents have altered steadily with the rise and fall of AIDS-related mycoses, and the change in spectrum of fatal disseminated fungal infections that has accompanied changes in therapeutic immunosuppressive therapies. The search for new molecular targets for antifungals has generated considerable research using modern genomic approaches, so far without generating new agents for clinical use. Meanwhile, six new antifungal agents have just reached, or are approaching, the clinic. Three are new triazoles, with extremely broad antifungal spectra, and three are echinocandins, which inhibit synthesis of fungal cell wall polysaccharides--a new mode of action. In addition, the sordarins represent a novel class of agents that inhibit fungal protein synthesis. This review describes the targets and mechanisms of action of all classes of antifungal agents in clinical use or with clinical potential.},

abstract = {Purpose: This report delineates the phenotypic features in a cohort of 58 individuals with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) and compares features of patients with the common microdeletion to those of patients with variable sized deletions, and the three previously reported patients who harbor a mutation in RAH (retinoic acid induced 1). Methods: From December 1990 thru September 1999, 58 persons with SMS were enrolled in a 5-day multidisciplinary clinical protocol at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), Texas Children's Hospital. Each patient had a cytogenetically evident deletion in 17p11.2. Results: Of the 51 patients in whom the molecular extent of the chromosomal deletion could be delineated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), 39 (≈76{\%}) had the common SMS deletion. Smaller or larger deletions were seen in ≈12{\%} and ≈10{\%} of patients, respectively, and 1 patient had a complex chromosomal rearrangement including a deletion in 17p11.2. Parent of origin was determined by polymorphic marker analysis in a subset of patients: maternal ≈43{\%}, paternal ≈57{\%}. All patients had impaired cognitive and adaptive functioning and had at least one objective measure of sleep disturbance. Other common features (seen in {\textgreater} 50{\%} of patients) include short stature, ophthalmological, and otolaryngological anomalies, hearing impairment, abnormal EEG, and scoliosis. Cardiac and renal anomalies were seen in ≈45{\%} and ≈19{\%} of patients, respectively. There are no statistically significant differences in the incidence of these abnormalities in patients with the common deletion compared to those patients with smaller or larger sized deletions. Conclusions: Despite a common deletion size in 76{\%} of patients with SMS, the only constant objectively defined features among these patients are sleep disturbances, low adaptive functioning, and mental retardation. There is no pathognomonic clinical feature, no characteristic cardiovascular defect, renal anomaly, otolaryngological or ophthalmic abnormality in SMS.},

abstract = {The intrinsic propensity of 1-antitrypsin to undergo conformational transitions from its metastable native state to hyperstable forms provides a motive force for its antiprotease function. However, aberrant conformational change can also occur via an intermolecular linkage that results in polymerization. This has both loss-of-function and gain-of-function effects that lead to deficiency of the protein in human circulation, emphysema and hepatic cirrhosis. One of the most promising therapeutic strategies being developed to treat this disease targets small molecules to an allosteric site in the 1-antitrypsin molecule. Partial filling of this site impedes polymerization without abolishing function. Drug development can be improved by optimizing data on the structure and dynamics of this site. A new 1.8 {\AA} resolution structure of 1-antitrypsin demonstrates structural variability within this site, with associated fluctuations in its upper and lower entrance grooves and ligand-binding characteristics around the innermost stable enclosed hydrophobic recess. These data will allow a broader selection of chemotypes and derivatives to be tested in silico and in vitro when screening and developing compounds to modulate conformational change to block the pathological mechanism while preserving function. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Union of Crystallography.

The success of C. albicans, the most prevalent and best studied Candida species, as both commensal and human pathogen depends on its genetic, biochemical, and morphological flexibility which facilitates adaptation to a wide range of host niches. In addition, formation of biofilms provides additional protection from adverse environmental conditions. Furthermore, in many host niches Candida cells coexist with members of the human microbiome. The resulting fungal-bacterial interactions have a major influence on the success of C. albicans as commensal and also influence disease development and outcome. In this chapter, we review the current knowledge of important survival strategies of Candida spp., focusing on fundamental fitness and virulence traits of C. albicans.},

The enzymes that produce PtdIns-4,5-P2 in vitro fall into two related subfamilies (type I and type II PtdInsP-5-OH kinases, or PIP(5)Ks) based on-their enzymatic properties and sequence similarities. Here we have reinvestigated the substrate specificities of these enzymes. As expected, the type I enzyme phosphorylates PtdIns-4-P at the D-5 position of the inositol ring. Surprisingly, the type II enzyme, which is abundant in some tissues, phosphorylates PtdIns-5-P at the D-4 position, and thus should be considered as a 4-OH kinase, or PIP(4)K. The earlier error in characterizing the activity of the type II enzyme is due to the presence of contaminating PtdIns-5-P in commercial preparations of PtdIns-4-P. Although PtdIns-5-P was previously thought not to exist in vivo, we find evidence for the presence of this lipid in mammalian fibroblasts, establishing a new pathway for PtdIns- 4,5-P2 synthesis.},

abstract = {Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS; OMIM {\#}182290) is a complex genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical features, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and a typical behavioral phenotype. SMS is caused by interstitial 17p11.2 deletions, encompassing multiple genes and including the retinoic acid-induced 1 gene (RAI1), or by mutations in RAI1 itself. About 10{\%} of all the SMS patients, in fact, carry an RAI1 mutation responsible for the phenotype. RAI1 (OMIM *607642) is a dosage-sensitive gene expressed in many tissues and highly conserved among species. Over the years, several studies have demonstrated that RAI1 (or its homologs in animal models) acts as a transcriptional factor implicated in embryonic neurodevelopment, neuronal differentiation, cell growth and cell cycle regulation, bone and skeletal development, lipid and glucose metabolisms, behavioral functions, and circadian activity. Patients with RAI1 pathogenic variants show some phenotypic differences when compared to those carrying the typical deletion. They usually have lower incidence of hypotonia and less cognitive impairment than those with 17p11.2 deletions but more frequently show the behavioral characteristics of the syndrome and overeating issues. These differences reflect the primary pathogenetic role of RAI1 without the pathogenetic contribution of the other genes included in the typical 17p11.2 deletion. The better comprehension of physiological roles of RAI1, its molecular co-workers and interactors, and its contribution in determining the typical SMS phenotype will certainly open a new path for therapeutic interventions.},

Recognition of a nonsense mRNA depends on translation and on the presence of NMD-enhancing or the absence of NMD-inhibiting factors in the 30-untranslated region. Our review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular function of the conserved NMD factors UPF3B and UPF1, and of the anti-NMD factor Poly(A)-binding protein, and their interactions with ribosomes translating PTC-containing mRNAs. Our recent discovery that UPF3B interferes with human translation termination and enhances ribosome dissociation in vitro, whereas UPF1 is inactive in these assays, suggests a re-interpretation of previous experiments and modification of prevalent NMD models. Moreover, we discuss recent work suggesting new functions of the key NMD factor UPF1 in ribosome recycling, inhibition of translation re-initiation and nascent chain ubiquitylation. These new findings suggest that the interplay of UPF proteins with the translation machinery is more intricate than previously appreciated, and that this interplay quality-controls the efficiency of termination, ribosome recycling and translation re-initiation.},

Mice that are homozygous for a mutation in the inv gene (inv/inv) develop renal cysts resembling autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease. The gene locus containing inv has been proposed to serve as a common modifier for some human and rodent polycystic kidney disease phenotypes. We generated polyclonal antibodies to inversin to study its subcellular distribution, potential binding partners, and functional aspects in cultured murine proximal tubule cells. A 125-kDa inversin protein isoform was found at cell-cell junctions. Two inversin isoforms, 140- and 90-kDa, were identified in the nuclear and perinuclear compartments. Plasma membrane allocation of inversin is dependent upon cell-cell contacts and was redistributed when cell adhesion was disrupted after incubation of the cell monolayer with low-calcium/EGTA medium. We further show that the membrane-associated 125-kDa inversin forms a complex with N-cadherin and the catenins. The 90-kDa nuclear inversin complexes with $\beta$-catenin. These findings indicate that the inv gene product functions in several cellular compartments, including the nucleus and cell-cell adhesion sites.},

abstract = {To understand better the mechanisms of resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type multidrug efflux pumps, we examined the Escherichia coli AcrD pump, whose typical substrates, aminoglycosides, are not expected to diffuse spontaneously across the lipid bilayer. The hexahistidine-tagged AcrD protein was purified and reconstituted into unilamellar proteoliposomes. Its activity was measured by the proton flux accompanying substrate transport. When the interior of the proteoliposomes was acidified, the addition of aminoglycosides to the external medium stimulated proton efflux and the intravesicular accumulation of radiolabeled gentamicin, suggesting that aminoglycosides can be captured and transported from the external medium in this system (corresponding to cytosol). This activity required the presence of AcrA within the proteoliposomes. Interestingly, the increase in proton efflux also occurred when aminoglycosides were present only in the intravesicular space. This result suggested that AcrD can also capture aminoglycosides from the periplasm to extrude them into the medium in intact cells, acting as a "periplasmic vacuum cleaner."},

Although most infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised or debilitated in some other way, the organism most often responsible for disease, Candida albicans, expresses several virulence factors that contribute to pathogenesis. These factors include host recognition biomolecules (adhesins), morphogenesis (the reversible transition between unicellular yeast cells and filamentous, growth forms), secreted aspartyl proteases and phospholipases. Additionally, 'phenotypic switching' is accompanied by changes in antigen expression, colony morphology and tissue affinities in C. albicans and several other Candida spp. Switching might provide cells with a flexibility that results in the adaptation of the organism to the hostile conditions imposed not only by the host but also by the physician treating the infection.},

We recovered multiple new alleles of hh and dispatched ( disp ). In addition, we identified a novel component in the hh pathway, which we name central missing ( cmn ). Loss-of-function mutations in cmn cause similar patterning defects to those caused by hh or dispatched ( disp ) mutations. Moreover, cmn affects the expression of hh responsive genes but not of hh itself. Like disp , cmn acts upstream of patched ( ptc ) and its activity is required only in the Hh secreting cells. However, unlike disp , which is required for the release of the cholesterol-modified form of Hh, cmn regulates the activity of Hh in a manner that is independent of cholesterol modification. Finally, we show that cmn mutations bear molecular lesions in CG11495, which encodes a putative membrane bound acyltransferase related to Porcupine, a protein implicated in regulating the secretion of Wingless (Wg) signal.},

abstract = {To determine the location of the proteinase in the covalent serpin-proteinase complex we prepared seven single-cysteine-containing variants of the Pittsburgh variant of the serpin $\alpha$1-proteinase inhibitor, and we labeled each cysteine with the dansyl fluorophore. The dansyl probes were used to determine proximity of the proteinase trypsin in covalent and noncovalent complexes with the serpin, both by direct perturbation and by fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophans in trypsin to dansyl. Large direct effects on dansyl fluorophores were seen for only two positions in covalent complex and one position in noncovalent complex. Distances ranging from {\textless}14 {\AA} to 64 {\AA} were used to severely constrain possible structures for the complex. The structure consistent with both distance constraints and direct perturbations of the dansyl fluorophores placed the proteinase at the distal end of the serpin from the initial docking site. This position for the proteinase requires complete translocation of the proteinase from one end of the serpin to the other and full insertion of the reactive center loop into $\beta$-sheet A to form the kinetically trapped complex. The consequent tight juxtapositioning of serpin and proteinase could explain how distortion of the proteinase active site can occur and hence how many combinations of serpin and proteinase can be inhibited by a common conformational change mechanism.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vulvovaginal candidiasis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis remain a significant problem in women of child-bearing age. While host defense mechanisms against infection are poorly understood, the most recent studies continue to challenge dogma relative to anti-Candida immunity at other mucosal sites that is normally associated with T helper 1-type CD4 T cells.

RECENT FINDINGS: Four studies comprise the latest findings in host defense against vulvovaginal candidiasis. The first from an animal model provided the most definitive data to date for the lack of involvement by systemic or local T-cell-mediated immunity. The second study confirmed a limited role for antibodies in vaginal candidiasis; similar to past studies, systemic and local Candida-specific antibodies in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis were either similar or elevated compared with controls. The third study from a cohort of adolescents provided evidence for some form of local protective immunity based on high asymptomatic vaginal fungal burden with low incidence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis. This was addressed more specifically through a natural history protocol involving an intravaginal challenge with live Candida. Results showed a strong correlation between infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, with no evidence of an inflammatory response in those protected against infection.

SUMMARY: Instead of vulvovaginal candidiasis being caused by defective or dysfunctional CD4 T helper 1-type cell-mediated immune reactivity, data suggest that symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis is associated with an aggressive response by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, whereas protection appears to be innate and noninflammatory. The role for innate immunity in both protection against, and promotion of, symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis is paradigm changing.},

Specific recognition of thymine residues in the ACS is carried out by a conserved basic amino acid motif of Orc1 in the minor groove, and by a species-specific helical insertion motif of Orc4 in the major groove. Moreover, similar insertions into major and minor grooves are also embedded in the B1 site by basic patch motifs from Orc2 and Orc5, respectively, to contact bases and to bend DNA. This work pinpoints a conserved role of ORC in modulating DNA structure to facilitate origin selection and helicase loading in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {The genetics of body asymmetry in Lymnaea peregra follows a maternal mode of inheritance involving a single locus with dextrality being dominant to sinistrality. Maternal inheritance implies that all members of a brood have the same phenotype, however, some broods contain a few individuals of opposite coil. One purpose of this paper is to explain the origin of these anomalous individuals. Genetic analyses of sinistral broods with a few dextral individuals have led to the development of a cross-over model, with the anomalous dextrals originating as a consequence of crossing over either during meiosis or mitosis in the female germ line. The crossover either reconstitutes the dextral gene from previously dissociated parts, or creates a dextral gene by means of a position effect. The probability of a crossover event depends upon the appropriate combination of complementary sinistral chromosomes. Each crossover event has the potential of creating a unique dextral gene. Genetic analyses of dextral broods containing a few sinistral individuals have demonstrated that different dextral genes vary in penetrance. The dextral gene produces a product during oogenesis which influences the pattern of cleavage in the embryo; this cleavage pattern is translated into the appropriate body asymmetry. The other purpose of this paper is to provide an assay for this gene product. Cytoplasm from dextral eggs injected into uncleaved sinistral eggs causes these eggs to cleave in a dextral pattern. Cytoplasm from sinistral eggs has no effect on the cleavage pattern of dextral eggs. While the dextral gene product is made during oogenesis, it does not function in controlling cleavage until just before this process begins. {\textcopyright} 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, G proteins, propagate incoming messages from receptors to effector proteins. They switch from an inactive to active state by exchanging a GDP molecule for GTP, and they return to the inactive form by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP. Small monomeric G proteins, such as Ras, are involved in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and they interact with membranes through isoprenyl moieties, fatty acyl moieties, and electrostatic interactions. This protein-lipid binding facilitates productive encounters of Ras and Raf proteins in defined membrane regions, so that signals can subsequently proceed through MEK and ERK kinases, which constitute the canonical MAP kinase signaling cassette. On the other hand, heterotrimeric G proteins undergo co/post-translational modifications in the alpha (myristic and/or palmitic acid) and the gamma (farnesol or geranylgeraniol) subunits. These modifications not only assist the G protein to localize to the membrane but they also help distribute the heterotrimer (G$\alpha$$\beta$$\gamma$) and the subunits generated upon activation (G$\alpha$ and G$\beta$$\gamma$) to appropriate membrane microdomains. These proteins transduce messages from ubiquitous serpentine receptors, which control important functions such as taste, vision, blood pressure, body weight, cell proliferation, mood, etc. Moreover, the exchange of GDP by GTP is triggered by nucleotide exchange factors. Membrane receptors that activate G proteins can be considered as such, but other cytosolic, membranal or amphitropic proteins can accelerate the rate of G protein exchange or even activate this process in the absence of receptor-mediated activation. These and other protein-protein interactions of G proteins with other signaling proteins are regulated by their lipid preferences. Thus, G protein-lipid interactions control the features of messages and cell physiology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Invariant patterning of left-right asymmetry during embryogenesis depends upon a cascade of inductive and repressive interactions between asymmetrically expressed genes. Different cascades of asymmetric genes distinguish the left and right sides of the embryo and are maintained by a midline barrier. As such, the left and right sides of an embryo can be viewed as distinct and autonomous fields. Here we describe a series of experiments that indicate that the initiation of these programs requires communication between the two sides of the blastoderm. When deprived of either the left or the right lateral halves of the blastoderm, embryos are incapable of patterning normal left-right gene expression at Hensen's node. Not only are both flanks required, suggesting that there is no single signaling source for LR pattern, but the blastoderm must be intact. These results are consistent with our previously proposed model in which the orientation of LR asymmetry in the frog, Xenopus laevis, depends on large-scale partitioning of LR determinants through intercellular gap junction channels. Here we evaluate whether gap junctional communication is required for the LR asymmetry in the chick, where it is possible to order early events relative to the well-characterized left and right hierarchies of gene expression. Treatment of cultured chick embryos with lindane, which diminishes gap junctional communication, frequently unbiased normal LR asymmetry of Shh and Nodal gene expression, causing the normally left-sided program to be recapitulated symmetrically on the right side of the embryo. A survey of early expression of connexin mRNAs revealed that Cx43 is present throughout the blastoderm at Hamburger-Hamilton stage 2-3, prior to known asymmetric gene expression. Application of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking antibody to cultured embryos also resulted in bilateral expression of Shh and Nodal transcripts. Importantly, the node and primitive streak at these stages lack Cx43 mRNA. This result, together with the requirement for an intact blastoderm, suggests that the path of communication through gap junction channels circumvents the node and streak. We propose that left-right information is transferred unidirectionally throughout the epiblast by gap junction channels in order to pattern left-sided Shh expression at Hensen's node.},

Recognition of mannosyl residues was mediated by mannose receptor binding to N-linked mannosyl residues and by TLR4 binding to O-linked mannosyl residues. Residual cytokine production was mediated by recognition of beta-glucan by the dectin-1/TLR2 receptor complex. C. albicans mutants with a cell wall defective in mannosyl residues were less virulent in experimental disseminated candidiasis and elicited reduced cytokine production in vivo. We concluded that recognition of C. albicans by monocytes/macrophages is mediated by 3 recognition systems of differing importance, each of which senses specific layers of the C. albicans cell wall.},

However, the mechanism by which the rotational movement of node cilia can generate a unidirectional flow remains hypothetical. Here we have addressed this question by motion and morphological analyses of the node cilia and by fluid dynamic model experiments. We found that the cilia stand, not perpendicular to the node surface, but tilted posteriorly. We further confirmed that such posterior tilt can produce leftward flow in model experiments. These results strongly suggest that L-R asymmetry is not the descendant of pre-existing L-R asymmetry within each cell but is generated de novo by combining three sources of spatial information: antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, and the chirality of ciliary movement. {\textcopyright} 2005 Nonaka et al.},

abstract = {Background: Transmembrane helices (TMHs) frequently occur amongst protein architectures as means for proteins to attach to or embed into biological membranes. Physical constraints such as the membrane's hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential apply uniform requirements to TMHs and their flanking regions; consequently, they are mirrored in their sequence patterns (in addition to TMHs being a span of generally hydrophobic residues) on top of variations enforced by the specific protein's biological functions. Results: With statistics derived from a large body of protein sequences, we demonstrate that, in addition to the positive charge preference at the cytoplasmic inside (positive-inside rule), negatively charged residues preferentially occur or are even enriched at the non-cytoplasmic flank or, at least, they are suppressed at the cytoplasmic flank (negative-not-inside/negative-outside (NNI/NO) rule). As negative residues are generally rare within or near TMHs, the statistical significance is sensitive with regard to details of TMH alignment and residue frequency normalisation and also to dataset size; therefore, this trend was obscured in previous work. We observe variations amongst taxa as well as for organelles along the secretory pathway. The effect is most pronounced for TMHs from single-pass transmembrane (bitopic) proteins compared to those with multiple TMHs (polytopic proteins) and especially for the class of simple TMHs that evolved for the sole role as membrane anchors. Conclusions: The charged-residue flank bias is only one of the TMH sequence features with a role in the anchorage mechanisms, others apparently being the leucine intra-helix propensity skew towards the cytoplasmic side, tryptophan flanking as well as the cysteine and tyrosine inside preference. These observations will stimulate new prediction methods for TMHs and protein topology from a sequence as well as new engineering designs for artificial membrane proteins.},

abstract = {The concept that underlies this paper is that carbon dioxide (CO2) removal is at least as important as the delivery of oxygen for maximum performance during exercise. Increases in CO2 pressure and reductions in the pH of muscle influence muscle contractile properties and muscle metabolism (via effects on rate-limiting enzymes), and contribute to limiting symptoms. The approach of Barcroft exemplified the importance of integrative physiology, in describing the adaptive responses of the circulatory and respiratory systems to the demands of CO2 production during exercise. The extent to which failure in the response of one system may be countered by adaptation in another is also explained by this approach. A key factor in these linked systems is the transport of CO2 in the circulation. CO2 is mainly (90{\%}) transported as bicarbonate ions--as such, transport of CO2 is critically related to acid-base homeostasis. Understanding in this field has been facilitated by the approach of Peter Stewart. Rooted in classical physico-chemical relationships, the approach identifies the independent variables contributing to homeostasis--the strong ion difference ([SID]), ionization of weak acids (buffers, Atot) and CO2 pressure (PCO2). The independent variables may be reliably measured or estimated in muscle, plasma, and whole blood. Equilibrium conditions are calculated to derive the dependent variables--the most important being the concentrations of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. During heavy exercise, muscle [H+] can exceed 300 nEq.L-1 (pH 6.5), mainly due to a greatly elevated PCO2 and fall in [SID] as a result of increased lactate (La-) production. As blood flows through active muscle, [La-] increase in plasma is reduced by uptake of La- and Cl- by red blood cells, with a resultant increase in plasma [HCO3-]. Inactive muscle contributes to homeostasis through transfer of La- and Cl- into the muscle from both plasma and red blood cells; this results in a large increase in [HCO3-]. In the lungs, oxygenation of hemoglobin increases red blood cell [A-] aiding rapid conversion of HCO3- into CO2 in red cells (containing carbonic anhydrase), with diffusion of CO2 into alveoli, but full equilibration of the CO2 system in plasma may not occur during the short pulmonary capillary circulation time in heavy exercise. The ionization state of imidazole groups on protein histidine may provide integration between acid-base homeostasis, membrane anion transfer proteins, and activation of rate-limiting enzymes.},

The development of molecular cloning techniques, ironically instigated largely by phage lambda researchers, allowed many phage workers to switch their efforts to other biological systems. Nonetheless, since that time the ongoing study of lambda and its relatives has continued to give important new insights. In this review we give some relevant early history and describe recent developments in understanding the molecular biology of lambda's life cycle.},

abstract = {The polymorphic fungus Candida albicans is a member of the normal human microbiome. In most individuals, C. albicans resides as a lifelong, harmless commensal. Under certain circumstances, however, C. albicans can cause infections that range from superficial infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic infections. Several factors and activities have been identified which contribute to the pathogenic potential of this fungus. Among them are molecules which mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, the secretion of hydrolases, the yeast-to-hypha transition, contact sensing and thigmotropism, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching and a range of fitness attributes. Our understanding of when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to infection has significantly increased during the last years. In addition, novel virulence mechanisms have recently been discovered. In this review we present an update on our current understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of this important human pathogen.},

@article{Dostal2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans can proliferate in environments with different carbon dioxide concentrations thanks to the carbonic anhydrase CaNce103p, which accelerates spontaneous conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and vice versa. Without functional CaNce103p, C. albicans cannot survive in atmospheric air. CaNce103p falls into the $\beta$-carbonic anhydrase class, along with its ortholog ScNce103p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The crystal structure of CaNce103p is of interest because this enzyme is a potential target for surface disinfectants. Results: Recombinant CaNce103p was prepared in E. coli, and its crystal structure was determined at 2.2 {\AA} resolution. CaNce103p forms a homotetramer organized as a dimer of dimers, in which the dimerization and tetramerization surfaces are perpendicular. Although the physiological role of CaNce103p is similar to that of ScNce103p from baker's yeast, on the structural level it more closely resembles carbonic anhydrase from the saprophytic fungus Sordaria macrospora, which is also tetrameric. Dimerization is mediated by two helices in the N-terminal domain of the subunits. The N-terminus of CaNce103p is flexible, and crystals were obtained only upon truncation of the first 29 amino acids. Analysis of CaNce103p variants truncated by 29, 48 and 61 amino acids showed that residues 30-48 are essential for dimerization. Each subunit contains a zinc atom in the active site and displays features characteristic of type I $\beta$-carbonic anhydrases. Zinc is tetrahedrally coordinated by one histidine residue, two cysteine residues and a molecule of $\beta$-mercaptoethanol originating from the crystallization buffer. The active sites are accessible via substrate tunnels, which are slightly longer and narrower than those observed in other fungal carbonic anhydrases. Conclusions: CaNce103p is a $\beta$-class homotetrameric metalloenzyme composed of two homodimers. Its structure closely resembles those of other $\beta$-type carbonic anhydrases, in particular CAS1 from Sordaria macrospora. The main differences occur in the N-terminal part and the substrate tunnel. Detailed knowledge of the CaNce103p structure and the properties of the substrate tunnel in particular will facilitate design of selective inhibitors of this enzyme.},

In favorable conditions, this multiprotein system catalyzes the synthesis of several copies of the input DNA template in a 30- to 60-min incubation. The replication forks produced in vitro move in a highly processive fashion, at approximately the in vivo rate of 500 nucleotides per s. The DNA synthesized on the lagging side of the in vitro replication fork is made discontinuously, as it is in vivo, giving rise to 'Okazaki pieces' averaging some 10,000 nucleotides in length; in contrast, DNA is polymerized in a continuous manner on the leading side of the in vitro fork. Although the mechanism by which the seven-protein in vitro DNA replication system propagates replication forks closely resembles the in vivo mechanism, it lacks the capacity to remove RNA primers, to reseal Okazaki pieces, and to initiate replication forks at defined DNA origins; supplementation of the system with additional T4-specific replication proteins will be required to facilitate these latter three functions.},

There is currently no cure for SMS. Here, we generated a genetic mouse model to determine the reversibility of SMS-like neurobehavioral phenotypes in Rai1 heterozygous mice. We show that normalizing the Rai1 level 3-4 wk after birth corrected the expression of genes related to neural developmental pathways and fully reversed a social interaction deficit caused by Rai1 haploinsufficiency. In contrast, Rai1 reactivation 7-8 wk after birth was not beneficial. We also demonstrated that the correct Rai1 dose is required in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons for proper social interactions. Finally, we found that Rai1 heterozygous mice exhibited a reduction of dendritic spines in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and that optogenetic activation of mPFC neurons in adults improved the social interaction deficit of Rai1 heterozygous mice. Together, these results suggest the existence of a postnatal temporal window during which restoring Rai1 can improve the transcriptional and social behavioral deficits in a mouse model of SMS. It is possible that circuit-level interventions would be beneficial beyond this critical window.},

This mechanism is vulnerable to mutations which result in inappropriate intra- or intermolecular loop insertion in the absence of cleavage. Intermolecular loop insertion is known as serpin polymerisation and results in a variety of diseases, most notably liver cirrhosis resulting from mutations of the prototypical serpin $\alpha$1-antitrypsin. We present here the 2.6 {\AA} structure of a polymer of $\alpha$1-antitrypsin cleaved six residues N-terminal to the reactive centre, P7-P6 (Phe352-Leu353). After self insertion of P14 to P7, intermolecular linkage is affected by insertion of the P6-P3 residues of one molecule into the partially occupied $\beta$-sheet A of another. This results in an infinite, linear polymer which propagates in the crystal along a 2-fold screw axis. These findings provide a framework for understanding the uncleaved $\alpha$1-antitrypsin polymer and fibrillar and amyloid deposition of proteins seen in other conformational diseases, with the ordered array of polymers in the crystal resulting from slow accretion of the cleaved serpin over the period of a year.},

Its ability to change morphology, from yeast to filamentous forms, in response to host environmental cues is important for virulence .

The distantly related basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that predominantly infects the central nervous system in immunocompromised patients . Similar to the morphological change in C. albicans, capsule biosynthesis in C. neoformans, a major virulence attribute, is also dependent upon adenylyl cyclase activity . Here we demonstrate that physiological concentrations of CO2/HCO3- induce filamentation in C. albicans by direct stimulation of cyclase activity. Furthermore, we show that CO2/HCO3- equilibration by carbonic anhydrase is essential for pathogenesis of C. albicans in niches where the available CO2 is limited. We also demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase from C. neoformans is sensitive to physiological concentrations of CO2/HCO3-. These data demonstrate that the link between cAMP signaling and CO2/HCO3- sensing is conserved in fungi and reveal CO2 sensing to be an important mediator of fungal pathogenesis.

We investigated the distribution of C. parapsilosis complex species in 122 isolates from blood and other sources in a southern Spain tertiary-care hospital, and we examined the relationship between species, site of isolation and biofilm positivity. We also evaluated the planktonic MICs and sessile MICs (SMICs) of voriconazole, amphotericin B and anidulafungin. One hundred and eleven isolates (91{\%}) were categorized as C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, whereas ten isolates (8.2{\%}) were categorized as C. orthopsilosis and one (0.8{\%}) as C. metapsilosis. Biofilm positivity was observed in 58.5{\%} (65 of 111) of C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates vs. 0{\%} (0 of 11) of C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis isolates (p {\textless}0.01). There was no difference in biofilm production among C. parapsilosis sensu stricto isolates from blood and other sources. MIC values showed that all isolates were susceptible to voriconazole and amphotericin B, whereas two isolates (1.8{\%}) of C. parapsilosis sensu stricto were non-susceptible to anidulafungin. However, the MIC₉₀ value of voriconazole was higher (0.125 mg/L) for C. orthopsilosis than for C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (0.03 mg/L). In contrast to planktonic cells, the SMICs show that amphotericin B and anidulafungin are moderately effective against the biofilm of C. parapsilosis sensu stricto, whereas voriconazole is ineffective.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane and the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton undergo continuous dynamic interplay that is responsible for many essential aspects of cell physiology. Polymerization of actin filaments against cellular membranes provides the force for a number of cellular processes such as migration, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. Plasma membrane phosphoinositides (especially phosphatidylinositol bis- and trisphosphates) play a central role in regulating the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by acting as platforms for protein recruitment, by triggering signaling cascades, and by directly regulating the activities of actin-binding proteins. Furthermore, a number of actin-associated proteins, such as BAR domain proteins, are capable of directly deforming phosphoinositide-rich membranes to induce plasma membrane protrusions or invaginations. Recent studies have also provided evidence that the actin cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interactions are misregulated in a number of pathological conditions such as cancer and during pathogen invasion. Here, we summarize the wealth of knowledge on how the cortical actin cytoskeleton is regulated by phosphoinositides during various cell biological processes. We also discuss the mechanisms by which interplay between actin dynamics and certain membrane deforming proteins regulate the morphology of the plasma membrane.

abstract = {We have developed video microscopy methods to visualize the assembly and disassembly of individual microtubules at 33-ms intervals. Porcine brain tubulin, free of microtubule-associated proteins, was assembled onto axoneme fragments at 37 degrees C, and the dynamic behavior of the plus and minus ends of microtubules was analyzed for tubulin concentrations between 7 and 15.5 microM. Elongation and rapid shortening were distinctly different phases. At each end, the elongation phase was characterized by a second order association and a substantial first order dissociation reaction. Association rate constants were 8.9 and 4.3 microM-1 s-1 for the plus and minus ends, respectively; and the corresponding dissociation rate constants were 44 and 23 s-1. For both ends, the rate of tubulin dissociation equaled the rate of tubulin association at 5 microM. The rate of rapid shortening was similar at the two ends (plus = 733 s-1; minus = 915 s-1), and did not vary with tubulin concentration. Transitions between phases were abrupt and stochastic. As the tubulin concentration was increased, catastrophe frequency decreased at both ends, and rescue frequency increased dramatically at the minus end. This resulted in fewer rapid shortening phases at higher tubulin concentrations for both ends and shorter rapid shortening phases at the minus end. At each concentration, the frequency of catastrophe was slightly greater at the plus end, and the frequency of rescue was greater at the minus end. Our data demonstrate that microtubules assembled from pure tubulin undergo dynamic instability over a twofold range of tubulin concentrations, and that the dynamic instability of the plus and minus ends of microtubules can be significantly different. Our analysis indicates that this difference could produce treadmilling, and establishes general limits on the effectiveness of length redistribution as a measure of dynamic instability. Our results are consistent with the existence of a GTP cap during elongation, but are not consistent with existing GTP cap models.},

abstract = {Consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of the bodyplan across phyla, and errors of laterality form an important class of human birth defects. Its molecular underpinning was first discovered as a sequential pathway of left-and right-sided gene expression that controlled positioning of the heart and visceral organs. Recent data have revised this picture in two important ways. First, the physical origin of chirality has been identified; cytoskeletal dynamics underlie the asymmetry of single-cell behaviour and patterning of the LR axis. Second, the pathway is not linear: early disruptions that alter the normal sidedness of upstream asymmetric genes do not necessarily induce defects in the laterality of the downstream genes or in organ situs. Thus, the LR pathway is a unique example of two fascinating aspects of biology: the interplay of physics and genetics in establishing largescale anatomy, and regulative (shape-homeostatic) pathways that correct molecular and anatomical errors over time. Here, we review aspects of asymmetry from its intracellular, cytoplasmic origins to the recently uncovered ability of the LR control circuitry to achieve correct gene expression and morphology despite reversals of key ‘determinant' genes. We provide novel functional data, in Xenopus laevis, on conserved elements of the cytoskeleton that drive asymmetry, and comparatively analyse it together with previously published results in the field. Our new observations and meta-analysis demonstrate that despite aberrant expression of upstream regulatory genes, embryos can progressively normalize transcriptional cascades and anatomical outcomes. LR patterning can thus serve as a paradigm of how subcellular physics and gene expression cooperate to achieve developmental robustness of a body axis.

Samples for surveillance cultures were obtained from health care worker hands, central venous catheter insertion sites, and medical devices. Twenty-six percent of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated hand colonization with C. parapsilosis, and one hand isolate was highly related to all case-patient isolates by tests with the DNA probe Cp3-13. Outbreak strain isolates also demonstrated reduced susceptibilities to fluconazole and voriconazole. This largest known reported outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections in adults resulted from an interplay of host, environment, and pathogen factors.

While Drosophila forms the entire axis within a syncytial blastoderm using transcription factors as morphogens, zebrafish uses signaling factors in a cellularized embryo, progressively forming the AP axis over the course of a day. Tribolium uses an intermediate strategy that has commonalities with both Drosophila and zebrafish.

abstract = {Candida albicans is a major fungal pathogen of humans. This yeast is carried by many individuals as a harmless commensal, but when immune defences are perturbed it causes mucosal infections (thrush). Additionally, when the immune system becomes severely compromised, C. albicans often causes life-threatening systemic infections. A battery of virulence factors and fitness attributes promote the pathogenicity of C. albicans. Fitness attributes include robust responses to local environmental stresses, the inactivation of which attenuates virulence. Stress signalling pathways in C. albicans include evolutionarily conserved modules. However, there has been rewiring of some stress regulatory circuitry such that the roles of a number of regulators in C. albicans have diverged relative to the benign model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This reflects the specific evolution of C. albicans as an opportunistic pathogen obligately associated with warm-blooded animals, compared with other yeasts that are found across diverse environmental niches. Our understanding of C. albicans stress signalling is based primarily on the in vitro responses of glucose-grown cells to individual stresses. However, in vivo this pathogen occupies complex and dynamic host niches characterised by alternative carbon sources and simultaneous exposure to combinations of stresses (rather than individual stresses). It has become apparent that changes in carbon source strongly influence stress resistance, and that some combinatorial stresses exert non-additive effects upon C. albicans. These effects, which are relevant to fungus-host interactions during disease progression, are mediated by multiple mechanisms that include signalling and chemical crosstalk, stress pathway interference and a biological transistor.},

abstract = {Ever since cloning the classic iv (inversedviscerum) mutation identified the "left-right dynein" (lrd) gene in mice, most research on body laterality determination has focused on its function in motile cilia at the node embryonic organizer. This model is attractive, as it links chirality of cilia architecture to asymmetry development. However, lrd is also expressed in blastocysts and embryonic stem cells, where it was shown to bias the segregation of recombined sister chromatids away from each other in mitosis. These data suggested that lrd is part of a cellular mechanism that recognizes and selectively segregates sister chromatids based on their replication history: old "Watson" versus old "Crick" strands. We previously proposed that the mouse left-right axis is established via an asymmetric cell division prior to/or during gastrulation. In this model, left-right dynein selectively segregates epigenetically differentiated sister chromatids harboring a hypothetical "left-right axis development 1" ("lra1") gene during the left-right axis establishing cell division. Here, asymmetry development would be ultimately governed by the chirality of the cytoskeleton and the DNA molecule. Our model predicts that randomization of chromatid segregation in lrd mutants should produce embryos with 25{\%} situs solitus, 25{\%} situs inversus, and 50{\%} embryonic death due to heterotaxia and isomerism. Here we confirmed this prediction by using two distinct lrd mutant alleles. Other than lrd, thus far Nodal gene is the most upstream function implicated in visceral organs laterality determination. We next tested whether the Nodal gene constitutes the lra1 gene hypothesized in the model by testing mutant's effect on 50{\%} embryonic lethality observed in lrd mutants. Since Nodal mutation did not suppress lethality, we conclude that Nodal is not equivalent to the lra1 gene. In summary, we describe the origin of 50{\%} lethality in lrd mutant mice not yet explained by any other laterality-generating hypothesis.},

Mitotic chromosome reorganization is marked by the general attenuation of transcription on chromosome arms, yet how the cell regulates nuclear and chromatin-associated RNAs after chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown is unknown. SAF-A/hnRNPU is an abundant nuclear protein with RNA-to-DNA tethering activity, coordinated by two spatially distinct nucleic acid–binding domains. Here we show that RNA is evicted from prophase chromosomes through Aurora-B–dependent phosphorylation of the SAF-A DNA-binding domain; failure to execute this pathway leads to accumulation of SAF-A–RNA complexes on mitotic chromosomes, defects in metaphase chromosome alignment, and elevated rates of chromosome missegregation in anaphase. This work reveals a role for Aurora-B in removing chromatin-associated RNAs during prophase and demonstrates that Aurora-B–dependent relocalization of SAF-A during cell division contributes to the fidelity of chromosome segregation.},

Using a Web-based electronic data capture and reporting system, the registry collects anonymous data to address end points in epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of IFIs. As of October 2006, 1892 IFIs were observed in 1710 patients enrolled at 22 sites. The most commonly encountered IFIs were caused by Candida spp. (73.0{\%}), presenting predominantly as candidemia, followed by Aspergillus spp. (14.8{\%}). A small number of IFIs with uncommon and emerging moulds were observed. Culture remains the main diagnostic tool for most IFIs (91.8{\%}). Antifungal agent choice depended on the fungal species isolated, with fluconazole being the most frequently administered agent (58.2{\%}). The overall crude 12-week mortality, excluding the patients lost to follow-up, was 43.9{\%}. PATH Alliance is a network of medical institutions gathering significant information about IFIs in North America.

abstract = {The precise specification of left-right asymmetry is an essential process for patterning internal organs in vertebrates. In mouse embryonic development, the symmetry-breaking process in left-right determination is initiated by a leftward extraembryonic fluid flow on the surface of the ventral node. However, it is not known whether the signal transduction mechanism of this flow is chemical or mechanical. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling triggers secretion of membrane-sheathed objects 0.3-5 $\mu$m in diameter termed 'nodal vesicular parcels' (NVPs) that carry Sonic hedgehog and retinoic acid. These NVPs are transported leftward by the fluid flow and eventually fragment close to the left wall of the ventral node. The silencing effects of the FGF-receptor inhibitor SU5402 on NVP secretion and on a downstream rise in Ca2+ were sufficiently reversed by exogenous Sonic hedgehog peptide or retinoic acid, suggesting that FGF-triggered surface accumulation of cargo morphogens may be essential for launching NVPs. Thus, we propose that NVP flow is a new mode of extracellular transport that forms a left-right gradient of morphogens.},

abstract = {KRAS mutations are the most common genetic abnormalities in cancer, but the distribution of specific mutations across cancers and the differential responses of patients with specific KRAS mutations in therapeutic clinical trials suggest that different KRAS mutations have unique biochemical behaviors. To further explain these high-level clinical differences and to explore potential therapeutic strategies for specific KRAS isoforms, we characterized the most common KRAS mutants biochemically for substrate binding kinetics, intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-stimulated GTPase activities, and interactions with the RAS effector, RAF kinase. Of note, KRAS G13D shows rapid nucleotide exchange kinetics compared with other mutants analyzed. This property can be explained by changes in the electrostatic charge distribution of the active site induced by the G13Dmutation as shown by Xray crystallography. High-resolution X-ray structures are also provided for the GDP-bound forms of KRAS G12V, G12R, and Q61L and reveal additional insight. Overall, the structural data and measurements, obtained herein, indicate that measurable biochemical properties provide clues for identifying KRASdriven tumors that preferentially signal through RAF. Implications: Biochemical profiling and subclassification of KRAS-driven cancers will enable the rational selection of therapies targeting specific KRAS isoforms or specific RAS effectors.},

abstract = {One of the attractive features of biomimetic catalysts is their amenability, relative to their enzyme counterparts, to the testing of structural and mechanistic hypotheses. Thus, the reproduction of the active site of an enzyme in a model system provides a tool which is free of much of the complexity of the enzyme. Using this approach, we describe a new model of the active site of the hydrolytic enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The model (1) is composed of a Zn2+ complex of the tripodal ligand 1,1,1-tris(aminomethyl)ethane. We find that, in analogy to CA, the complex possesses a water molecule whose pKa is reduced to 8.0 by coordination to the chelated Zn2+ ion. We demonstrate that the complex catalyses the hydrolysis of a model ester substrate (p-nitrophenyl acetate, p-NPA) with a second-order rate constant (k2) of 0.71 M−1 s−1 (55.0 °C, pH 8.20, ionic strength, I = 0.1 M, aqueous solution), and moreover that it does so with Michaelis–Menten kinetic behaviour (Km = 7.6 mM; 45.0 °C, pH 8.20, I = 0.1 M, 50{\%} v/v CH3CN–H2O). The comparison of these data with those for CA suggests that the hydrophobic cavity and Thr199 residue (which lie adjacent to the active-site of the enzyme) contribute only marginally to the pKa reduction of the Zn2+-bound water molecule. Despite the absence of these moieties, the chelated Zn2+ ion is still capable of forming an ‘enzyme–substrate'-like complex, but the stability of the complex is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the enzyme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are involved in inorganic carbon utilization. They have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta- CAs, with beta-CAs present in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of beta-CA Nce103/YNL036W. RESULTS: We determined the crystal structure of Nce103 in complex with a substrate analog at 2.04 A resolution. It assembles as a homodimer, with the active site located at the interface between two monomers. At the bottom of the substrate pocket, a zinc ion is coordinated by the three highly conserved residues Cys57, His112 and Cys115 in addition to a water molecule. Residues Asp59, Arg61, Gly111, Leu102, Val80, Phe75 and Phe97 form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a molecule of the substrate analog acetate. Activity assays of full length and two truncated versions of Nce103 indicated that the N-terminal arm is indispensable. CONCLUSION: The quaternary structure of Nce103 resembles the typical plant type beta-CAs of known structure, with an N-terminal arm indispensable for the enzymatic activity. Comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the substrate to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped substrate pocket.},

abstract = {Modern sequencing and manufacturing techniques have made it possible to design and encode specific functions in to DNA. This allows the manu-facture of complex genetic circuitry for use in a therapeutic setting. One of the current methods of introducing such circuits in to an animal is by implementing the circuit on a plasmid and transforming bacteria with that plasmid. The bacteria are then introduced to the animal and the bacterial machinery will carry out the processes encoded on the plasmid. A primary concern when using this method is the loss of plasmids from the bacterial population, due primarily to competition from plasmid-free bacteria. Cur-rently, an antibiotic resistance gene is placed on the plasmid and antibiotics are used in the environment in order to kill bacteria that lack the plasmid. Evidently, in a medical setting it is not appropriate to keep a patient on an antibiotics regime if it can be avoided. To that end, we build a modelling system in which one can observe how plasmid maintenance is affected by altering the various mechanisms which may control it. Further, we outline a toxin-antitoxin system which may prove to be an effective mechanism to control the growth of plasmid-free bacteria. 1 Synthetic Biology Synthetic biology aims to develop engineered system that behave in a pre-dictable manner with components adapted from existing biological solu-tions.

For biofilm formation, the Candida species were grown at different periods of time in YP or YNB media supplemented or not with 0.2 or 2{\%} glucose. Sessile and planktonic cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of antifungals, H2O2, menadione or silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Biofilms were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified by the XTT assay. C. albicans formed biofilms preferentially in YPD containing 2{\%} glucose (YPD/2{\%}), C. glabrata in glucose-free YNB or supplemented with 0.2{\%} glucose (YNB/0.2{\%}), while C. krusei and C. parapsilosis preferred YP, YPD/0.2{\%}, and YPD/2{\%}. Interestingly, only C. albicans produced an exopolymeric matrix. This is the first report dealing with the in vitro effect of the culture medium and glucose on the formation of biofilms in four Candida species as well as the resistance of sessile cells to antifungals, AgNPs, and ROS.

In malignancies identified as evolving neutrally, all clonal selection seemingly occurred before the onset of cancer growth and not in later-arising subclones, resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible for intratumoral heterogeneity.

abstract = {The development of handed asymmetry requires a special mechanism for consistently specifying a difference between left and right sides. This is to be distinguished from both random asymmetry, and from those left/right differences that are mirror symmetrical. We propose a model for the development of handedness in bilateral animals, comprising three components. (i) A process termed conversion, in which a molecular handedness is converted into handedness at the cellular level. A specific model for this process is put forward, based on cell polarity and transport of cellular constituents by a handed molecule. (ii) A mechanism for random generation of asymmetry, which could involve a reaction-diffusion process, so that the concentration of a molecule is higher on one side than the other. The handedness generated by conversion could consistently bias this mechanism to one side. (iii) A tissue-specific interpretation process which responds to the difference between the two sides, and results in the development of different structures on the left and right. There could be direct genetic control of the direction of handedness in this model, most probably through the conversion process. Experimental evidence for the model is considered, particularly the iv mutation in the mouse, which appears to result in loss-of-function in biasing, and so asymmetry is random. The model can explain the abnormal development of handedness observed in bisected embryos of some mammalian, amphibian and sub-vertebrate species. Spiral asymmetry, as seen in spiral cleavage and in ciliates, involves only conversion of molecular asymmetry to the cellular and multicellular level, with no separate interpretation step.},

abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) is a key lipid signaling molecule that regulates a vast array of biological activities. PI4,5P2 can act directly as a messenger or can be utilized as a precursor to generate other messengers: inositol trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. PI4,5P2 interacts with hundreds of different effector proteins. The enormous diversity of PI4,5P2 effector proteins and the spatio-temporal control of PI4,5P2 generation allow PI4,5P2 signaling to control a broad spectrum of cellular functions. PI4,5P2 is synthesized by phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs). The array of PIPKs in cells enables their targeting to specific subcellular compartments through interactions with targeting factors that are often PI4,5P2 effectors. These interactions are a mechanism to define spatial and temporal PI4,5P2 synthesis and the specificity of PI4,5P2 signaling. In turn, the regulation of PI4,5P2 effectors at specific cellular compartments has implications for understanding how PI4,5P2 controls cellular processes and its role in diseases. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.},

The allelic frequency for the most common protease inhibitor (PI) Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene is 2-5{\%} in Caucasians of European descent. The objective of our study was to estimate the PI Z mutation age using molecular analysis in Latvian and Swedish populations, which have the highest frequency of PI Z mutation. DNA samples of heterozygous and homozygous PI Z allele carriers from Latvia (n = 21) and Sweden (n = 65) were analysed; 113 unrelated healthy donors from Latvia were used as a control group. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on all samples. Pairwise Fst was computed to compare the PI Z mutation ages between the two populations and controls. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Analysis of non-recombinant SNPs revealed that the PI Z mutation age was 2902 years in Latvia (SD 1983) and 2362 years in Sweden (SD 1614) which correlates with previous studies based on microsatellite analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 University College London.},

Although several theories have been proposed, the biophysical mechanisms underlying LR asymmetry are still unclear, especially the role of cell chirality, the LR asymmetry at the cellular level, on organ asymmetry. Here with developing chicken embryos, we examine whether intrinsic cell chirality or handedness regulates cardiac C looping. Using a recently established biomaterial-based 3D culture platform, we demonstrate that chick cardiac cells before and during C looping are intrinsically chiral and exhibit dominant clockwise rotation in vitro. We further show that cells in the developing myocardium are chiral as evident by a rightward bias of cell alignment and a rightward polarization of the Golgi complex, correlating with the direction of cardiac tube rotation. In addition, there is an LR polarized distribution of N-cadherin and myosin II in the myocardium before the onset of cardiac looping. More interestingly, the reversal of cell chirality via activation of the protein kinase C signaling pathway reverses the directionality of cardiac looping, accompanied by a reversal in cellular biases on the cardiac tube. Our results suggest that myocardial cell chirality regulates cellular LR symmetry breaking in the heart tube and the resultant directionality of cardiac looping. Our study provides evidence of an intrinsic cellular chiral bias leading to LR symmetry breaking during directional tissue rotation in vertebrate development.},

abstract = {23 Males and females typically pursue divergent reproductive strategies and accordingly require 24 different dietary compositions to maximise their fitness. Here we move from identifying sex-25 specific optimal diets to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie male and 26 female responses to dietary variation. We examine male and female gene expression on male-27 optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We find that the sexes 28 share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly regulated in response to dietary 29 composition. However, we also observe smaller sets of genes with divergent and opposing 30 regulation, most notably in reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sex's 31 optimal diet. Our results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared 32 metabolic machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent 33 regulation of reproduction in males and females. Further analysis and experiments suggest 34 that this reverse regulation occurs within the IIS/TOR network. 35 36},

abstract = {Consistent laterality is a fascinating problem, and study of the Xenopus embryo has led to molecular characterization of extremely early steps in left-right patterning: bioelectrical signals produced by ion pumps functioning upstream of asymmetric gene expression. Here, we reveal a number of novel aspects of the H+/K+-ATPase module in chick and frog embryos. Maternal H+/K+-ATPase subunits are asymmetrically localized along the left-right, dorso-ventral, and animal-vegetal axes during the first cleavage stages, in a process dependent on cytoskeletal organization. Using a reporter domain fused to molecular motors, we show that the cytoskeleton of the early frog embryo can provide asymmetric, directional information for subcellular transport along all three axes. Moreover, we show that the Kir4.1 potassium channel, while symmetrically expressed in a dynamic fashion during early cleavages, is required for normal LR asymmetry of frog embryos. Thus, Kir4.1 is an ideal candidate for the K+ ion exit path needed to allow the electroneutral H+/K+-ATPase to generate voltage gradients. In the chick embryo, we show that H+/K+-ATPase and Kir4.1 are expressed in the primitive streak, and that the known requirement for H+/K+-ATPase function in chick asymmetry does not function through effects on the circumferential expression pattern of Connexin43. These data provide details crucial for the mechanistic modeling of the physiological events linking subcellular processes to large-scale patterning and suggest a model where the early cytoskeleton sets up asymmetric ion flux along the left-right axis as a system of planar polarity functioning orthogonal to the apical-basal polarity of the early blastomeres. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Neural induction constitutes the first step in the generation of the vertebrate nervous system from embryonic ectoderm. Work with Xenopus ectodermal explants has suggested that epidermis is induced by BMP signals, whereas neural fates arise by default following BMP inhibition. In amniotes and ascidians, however, BMP inhibition does not appear to be sufficient for neural fate acquisition, which is initiated by FGF signalling. We decided to re-evaluate in the context of the whole embryo the roles of the BMP and FGF pathways during neural induction in Xenopus. We find that ectopic BMP activity converts the neural plate into epidermis, confirming that this pathway must be inhibited during neural induction in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of BMP, or of its intracellular effector SMAD1 in the non-neural ectoderm leads to epidermis suppression. In no instances, however, is BMP/SMAD1 inhibition sufficient to elicit neural induction in ventral ectoderm. By contrast, we find that neural specification occurs when weak eFGF or low ras signalling are combined with BMP inhibition. Using all available antimorphic FGF receptors (FGFR), as well as the pharmacological FGFR inhibitor SU5402, we demonstrate that pre-gastrula FGF signalling is required in the ectoderm for the emergence of neural fates. Finally, we show that although the FGF pathway contributes to BMP inhibition, as in other model systems, it is also essential for neural induction in vivo and in animal caps in a manner that cannot be accounted for by simple BMP inhibition. Taken together, our results reveal that in contrast to predictions from the default model, BMP inhibition is required but not sufficient for neural induction in vivo. This work contributes to the emergence of a model whereby FGF functions as a conserved initiator of neural specification among chordates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are involved in inorganic carbon utilization. They have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta- CAs, with beta-CAs present in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of beta-CA Nce103/YNL036W. RESULTS: We determined the crystal structure of Nce103 in complex with a substrate analog at 2.04 A resolution. It assembles as a homodimer, with the active site located at the interface between two monomers. At the bottom of the substrate pocket, a zinc ion is coordinated by the three highly conserved residues Cys57, His112 and Cys115 in addition to a water molecule. Residues Asp59, Arg61, Gly111, Leu102, Val80, Phe75 and Phe97 form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a molecule of the substrate analog acetate. Activity assays of full length and two truncated versions of Nce103 indicated that the N-terminal arm is indispensable. CONCLUSION: The quaternary structure of Nce103 resembles the typical plant type beta-CAs of known structure, with an N-terminal arm indispensable for the enzymatic activity. Comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the substrate to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped substrate pocket.},

abstract = {Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation syndrome and it is characterized by an interstitial deletion of chromosome 17p11.2. SMS patients have a distinct phenotype which is believed to be caused by haploinsufficiency of one or more genes in the associated deleted region. Five non-deletion patients with classical phenotypic features of SMS have been reported with mutations in the retinoic acid induced 1 (RAI1) gene, located within the SMS critical interval. Happloinsufficiency of the RAI1 gene is likely to be the responsible gene for the majority of the SMS features, but other deleted genes in the SMS region may modify the overall phenotype in the patients with 17p11.2 deletions. SMS is usually diagnosed in the clinical genetic setting by FISH analysis using commercially available probes. We detected a submicroscopic deletion in 17p11.2 using array-CGH with a resolution of approximately 1:Mb in a patient with the SMS phenotype, who was not deleted for the commercially available SMS microdeletion FISH probe. Delineation of the deletion was performed using a 32K tiling BAC-array, containing 32,500 BAC clones. The deletion in this patient was size mapped to 2.7 Mb and covered the RAI1 gene. This case enabled the refinement of the SMS minimum deletion to ∼650 kb containing eight putative genes and one predicted gene. In addition, it demonstrates the importance to investigate deletion of RAI1 in SMS patients. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Candida parapsilosis is an important opportunistic pathogen with increasing prevalence. Extracellular lipases have been shown to play an important role in the virulence of pathogenic Candida species. However, studying the role of secreted lipase in C. albicans is challenging due to the lack of a mutant strain deficient in all 10 lipase genes. In contrast, we have previously constructed a lipase mutant C. parapsilosis strain lacking both CpLIP1 and CpLIP2, and shown that it has significantly decreased virulence in various infection models, and is killed more efficiently by mouse macrophages. In the present study, we compared the response of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages to a wild type (wt) as well as a lipase-deficient (lip(-/-)) C. parapsilosis strain that has been previously established in our lab. Although macrophages phagocytosed both strains with similar efficiency, lipase mutants were killed more efficiently according to fluorescent microscopic analysis. The more efficient killing of lip(-/-) cells was confirmed by CFU-determinations. Phagocytosis of wt and lip(-/-)C. parapsilosis was also examined by flow cytometry, revealing that both strains were internelized to the similar extent by macrophages. Additionally, quantitative imaging analysis revealed that the rate of phagolysosome fusion was higher in case of lip(-/-)C. parapsilosis. Interestingly, macrophages stimulated with lip(-/-)C. parapsilosis showed at least 1.5-fold higher expression of TNF$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, and PTGS-2 after 12 h compared with those infected with wt C. parapsilosis, as determined by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the lip(-/-)C. parapsilosis strain induced significantly higher TNF$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and IL-10 protein production in macrophages after 24 h compared with the wt strain. These findings confirm the role of fungal lipases as important virulence factors during C. parapsilosis infection.},

In addition to longrange chromatin loops, recent chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based studies have indicated higher levels of chromatin structures including compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs), which may serve as units of genome organization and functions. However, the molecular machinery underlying these hierarchically three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architectures remains poorly understood. Via high-throughput assays, including in situ Hi-C, DamID, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq, we investigated roles of the Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU), a nuclear matrix (NM)-associated protein, in 3D genome organization. Upon the depletion of HNRNPU in mouse hepatocytes, the coverage of lamina-associated domains (LADs) in the genome increases from 53.1{\%} to 68.6{\%}, and a global condensation of chromatin was observed. Furthermore, disruption of HNRNPU leads to compartment switching on 7.5{\%} of the genome, decreases TAD boundary strengths at borders between A (active) and B (inactive) compartments, and reduces chromatin loop intensities. Long-range chromatin interactions between and within compartments orTADs are also significantly remodeled upon HNRNPU depletion. Intriguingly, HNRNPU mainly associates with active chromatin, and 80{\%} of HNRNPU peaks coincide with the binding of CTCFor RAD21.

Arguably, one of the most significant innovations during animal evolutionary history was the establishment of a bilateral plane of symmetry on which morphological features (e.g. tissues, organs, appendages, skeleton) could be given specific coordinates within the animal along the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes. Hox genes are a known group of eumetazoan transcription factors central to regulating A-P patterning, but less well known and under current investigation is the broader regulatory landscape incorporating these genes, including microRNA (miRNA) regulation. The degree to which evolutionarily conserved targeting of Hox genes by Hox-embedded miRNAs contributes directly to A-P patterning is under investigation, yielding contrasting information dependent on the organism and miRNA of interest. The widespread A-P patterning defects observed in recent miR-196 loss-of-function studies solidifies the importance of miRNA regulation in Hox genetic hierarchies, and elucidating the developmental and evolutionary importance of all Hox-embedded miRNAs remains a challenge for the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.},

Receptor stimuli that hydrolyze PIP2 lowered adhesion energy, a process that could be mimicked by expressing PH domains that sequester PIP2 or by targeting a 5'-PIP2- phosphatase to the plasma membrane to selectively lower plasma membrane PIP2 concentration.

However, the predicted amino acid sequence of Nce103p shows high levels of identities to carbonic anhydrases of pro- and eukaryotes. A nce103-Delta deletion strain did not grow on a rich peptone-yeast extract-glucose medium under normal aerobic conditions at pH values of 3.0-8.0, but grew like wild-type in an oxygen-free nitrogen or oxygen-reduced atmosphere over this pH range, and was more sensitive to H(2)O(2) than wild-type. No carbonic anhydrase activity could be detected in crude extracts prepared from wild-type, nce103-Delta mutants or in strains transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying the NCE103 gene. Expression of the Medicago sativa carbonic anhydrase gene (Coba de la Pe{\~{n}}a et al., 1997), in a yeast expression cassette on a multicopy plasmid, complemented the growth defects caused by the nce103-Delta deletion and carbonic anhydrase activity could be readily detected in the crude extract. The ability of the nce103-Delta deletion strain to grow like wild-type under anaerobic conditions suggests that the protein encoded by NCE103 is required for protection against certain products of an oxidative metabolism and can be replaced in this function by the Medicago sativa carbonic anhydrase. A NCE103 promoter-LacZ fusion in a wild-type background showed that NCE103 is poorly transcribed under aerobic conditions and at an undetectable level under anaerobic conditions.},

During biosynthesis, Hh undergoes an autocleavage reaction, mediated by its carboxyl-terminal domain, that produces a lipid-modified amino-terminal fragment responsible for all known Hh signaling activity. Here it is reported that cholesterol is the lipophilic moiety covalently attached to the amino- terminal signaling domain during autoprocessing and that the carboxyl- terminal domain acts as an intramolecular cholesterol transferase. This use of cholesterol to modify embryonic signaling proteins may account for some of the effects of perturbed cholesterol biosynthesis on animal development.},

The rate constants for the uncatalyzed hydration of CO2 and dehydration of H2CO3 were 0.12 . s-1 and 58 . s-1, respectively, Km and turnover numbers in the hydration reaction were 14.0 mM and 19.1 . 10(5) . s-1 for HCAC and 3.3 mM and 0.56 . 10(5) . s-1 for HCA B. Km and turnover numbers in the dehydration reaction were 70 mM and 5 . 10(5) . s-1 for HCA C and 16.8 mM and 0.27 . 10(5) . s-1 for HCA B. Ki for chloride was 14 mM for HCA B and greater than 200 mM for HCA C. Ki for acetazolamide was 0.9 microM against HCA B and 16 nM against HCA C. The rates of hydration of CO2 in hemolysates with known concentrations of HCA B and HCA C, and in mixtures of purified HCA B and HCA C with concentrations near those in the erythrocyte, were similar to the rates calculated from the kinetic parameters of each isoenzyme. HCA B is 86{\%} inhibited by chloride in vivo. This strong inhibition, together with the low specific activity, explains why HCA B only accounts for 10{\%} of the total carbonic anhydrase activity of the erythrocyte, en spite the cellular concentration HCA B is 8 times higher than that of HCA C. HCA B and HCA C can together accelerate the intracellular CO2-reaction 23 000-fold, which gives a margin of 25-fold over physiological needs in hard work and 50-fold at rest. Perceptible physiological effects on respiration should therefore be seen when total carbonic anhydrase activity of erythrocytes is 96 to 98{\%} inhibited. These degrees of inhibition are achieved when plasma concentrations of acetazolamide reach 2 and 5 microM, respectively.},

The mannan adhesin fraction was encapsulated into liposomes and used to vaccinate mice over a 5- to 6-week period. Circulating agglutinins specific for the fraction correlated with increased resistance to disseminated candidiasis. Antiserum from vaccinated animals protected naive BALB/cByJ mice against C. albicans serotype A and B strains and Candida tropicalis. Antiserum also protected SCID mice against disseminated disease. The serum protective ability was stable at 56 degrees C, but this ability was adsorbed by C. albicans cells. The antiserum was divided into three fractions after separation by high-performance liquid chromatography. One fraction contained all of the agglutinin activity and transferred resistance to naive mice. A second fraction also transferred resistance. Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for candidal surface determinants were obtained. MAb B6.1 is specific for a mannan epitope in the adhesin fraction, and MAb B6 is specific for a different epitope in the fraction. Both MAbs are immunoglobulin M, and both strongly agglutinate candidal cells, but only MAb B6.1 protected both normal and SCID mice against disseminated candidiasis. In one experiment, 10 normal mice were given MAb B6.1 and challenged with yeast cells. Six mice survived the 67-day observation period; 4 of the survivors were cured as evidenced by the lack of CFU in the kidney and spleen. Our studies show that antibodies against certain cell surface antigens of C. albicans help the host resist disseminated candidiasis.},

They have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, epsilon-, zeta- CAs, with beta-CAs present in higher plants, algae and prokaryotes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single copy of beta-CA Nce103/YNL036W.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We determined the crystal structure of Nce103 in complex with a substrate analog at 2.04 A resolution. It assembles as a homodimer, with the active site located at the interface between two monomers. At the bottom of the substrate pocket, a zinc ion is coordinated by the three highly conserved residues Cys57, His112 and Cys115 in addition to a water molecule. Residues Asp59, Arg61, Gly111, Leu102, Val80, Phe75 and Phe97 form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a molecule of the substrate analog acetate. Activity assays of full length and two truncated versions of Nce103 indicated that the N-terminal arm is indispensable.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The quaternary structure of Nce103 resembles the typical plant type beta-CAs of known structure, with an N-terminal arm indispensable for the enzymatic activity. Comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the substrate to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped substrate pocket.},

abstract = {The entire functional even-skipped locus of Drosophila melanogaster is contained within a 16 kilobase region. As a transgene, this region is capable of rescuing even-skipped mutant flies to fertile adulthood. Detailed analysis of the 7.7 kb of regulatory DNA 3' of the transcription unit revealed ten novel, independently regulated patterns. Most of these patterns are driven by non-overlapping regulatory elements, including ones for syncytial blastoderm stage stripes 1 and 5, while a single element specifies both stripes 4 and 6. Expression analysis in gap gene mutants showed that stripe 5 is restricted anteriorly by Kruppel and posteriorly by giant, the same repressors that regulate stripe 2. Consistent with the coregulation of stripes 4 and 6 by a single cis-element, both the anterior border of stripe 4 and the posterior border of stripe 6 are set by zygotic hunchback, and the region between the two stripes is 'carved out' by knirps. Thus the boundaries of stripes 4 and 6 are set through negative regulation by the same gap gene domains that regulate stripes 3 and 7, but at different concentrations. The 3' region also contains a single element for neurogenic expression in ganglion mother cells 4-2a and 1-1a, and neurons derived from them (RP2, a/pCC), suggesting common regulators in these lineages. In contrast, separable elements were found for expression in EL neurons, U/CQ neurons and the mesoderm. The even-skipped 3' untranslated region is required to maintain late stage protein expression in RP2 and a/pCC neurons, and appears to affect protein levels rather than mRNA leveIs. Additionally a strong pairing-sensitive repression element was localized to the 3' end of the locus, but was not found to contribute to efficient functional rescue.},

We review here the differences between them that suggest that they are distinct morphological states.

abstract = {The establishment of left-right asymmetry in mammals is a good example of how multiple cell biological processes coordinate in the formation of a basic body plan. The leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, called nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking on the left-right axis. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the rotation of cilia that are tilted toward the posterior on cells of the ventral node. These cilia are built by transport via the KIF3 motor complex. How nodal flow is interpreted to create left-right asymmetry has been a matter of debate. Recent evidence suggests that the leftward movement of membrane-sheathed particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), may result in the activation of the noncanonical Hedgehog signaling pathway, an asymmetric elevation in intracellular Ca2+ and changes in gene expression. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The TGF$\beta$-related growth factor Nodal governs anteroposterior (AP) and left-right (LR) axis formation in the vertebrate embryo. A conserved intronic enhancer (ASE), containing binding sites for the fork head transcription factor Foxh1, modulates dynamic patterns of Nodal expression during early mouse development. This enhancer is responsible for early activation of Nodal expression in the epiblast and visceral endoderm, and at later stages governs asymmetric expression during LR axis formation. We demonstrate ASE activity is strictly Foxh1 dependent. Loss of this autoregulatory enhancer eliminates transcription in the visceral endoderm and decreases Nodal expression in the epiblast, but causes surprisingly discrete developmental abnormalities. Thus lowering the level of Nodal signaling in the epiblast disrupts both orientation of the AP axis and specification of the definitive endoderm. Targeted removal of the ASE also dramatically reduces left-sided Nodal expression, but the early events controlling LR axis specification are correctly initiated. However loss of the ASE disrupts Lefty2 (Leftb) expression and causes delayed Pitx2 expression leading to late onset, relatively minor LR patterning defects. The feedback loop is thus essential for maintenance of Nodal signals that selectively regulate target gene expression in a temporally and spatially controlled fashion in the mouse embryo.},

abstract = {Knowing the full set of essential genes for a given organism provides important information about ways to promote, and to limit, its growth and survival. For many non-model organisms, the lack of a stable haploid state and low transformation efficiencies impede the use of conventional approaches to generate a genome-wide comprehensive set of mutant strains and the identification of the genes essential for growth. Here we report on the isolation and utilization of a highly stable haploid derivative of the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, together with a modified heterologous transposon and machine learning (ML) analysis method, to predict the degree to which all of the open reading frames are required for growth under standard laboratory conditions. We identified 1,610 C. albicans essential genes, including 1,195 with high "essentiality confidence" scores, thereby increasing the number of essential genes (currently 66 in the Candida Genome Database) by {\textgreater}20-fold and providing an unbiased approach to determine the degree of confidence in the determination of essentiality. Among the genes essential in C. albicans were 602 genes also essential in the model budding and fission yeasts analyzed by both deletion and transposon mutagenesis. We also identified essential genes conserved among the four major human pathogens C. albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum and highlight those that lack homologs in humans and that thus could serve as potential targets for the design of antifungal therapies.IMPORTANCE Comprehensive understanding of an organism requires that we understand the contributions of most, if not all, of its genes. Classical genetic approaches to this issue have involved systematic deletion of each gene in the genome, with comprehensive sets of mutants available only for very-well-studied model organisms. We took a different approach, harnessing the power of in vivo transposition coupled with deep sequencing to identify {\textgreater}500,000 different mutations, one per cell, in the prevalent human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and to map their positions across the genome. The transposition approach is efficient and less labor-intensive than classic approaches. Here, we describe the production and analysis (aided by machine learning) of a large collection of mutants and the comprehensive identification of 1,610 C. albicans genes that are essential for growth under standard laboratory conditions. Among these C. albicans essential genes, we identify those that are also essential in two distantly related model yeasts as well as those that are conserved in all four major human fungal pathogens and that are not conserved in the human genome. This list of genes with functions important for the survival of the pathogen provides a good starting point for the development of new antifungal drugs, which are greatly needed because of the emergence of fungal pathogens with elevated resistance and/or tolerance of the currently limited set of available antifungal drugs.},

The products of genes W, D and F are not required for the formation of heads and the products of genes W and F are not essential for the formation of DNA filled heads. The product of gene E but not the products of genes A,W,B,C,D and F (and perhaps Nu3) are needed for the synthesis of monsters. Polyhead synthesis is depended on the products of genes E and C, but not of genes A, W, B, D and F. A model is proposed for the assembly of the gene E product. {\textcopyright} 1972.},

abstract = {Directional left/right (LR) asymmetries, in which there are consistent, heritable differences in morphology between the left and right sides of bilaterally symmetrical organisms, are found in animals across the Bilateria. For many years, we have lacked evidence for shared mechanisms underlying their development. This led to the supposition that the mechanisms driving establishment of LR asymmetries, and consequently the asymmetries themselves, had evolved separately in the three major Superphyla that constitute the Bilateria. The recent discovery that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) ligand Nodal plays a role in the regulation of LR asymmetry in both Deuterostomia and Lophotrochozoa has reignited debate in this field, as it suggests that at least this aspect of the development of the LR axis is conserved. In this review, we discuss evidence for shared mechanisms of LR asymmetry establishment across the bilaterian tree of life and consider how these mechanisms might have diverged across the Metazoa over the last 500 million years or so of evolution. As well as the likelihood that Nodal is an ancestral mechanism for regulating LR asymmetry, we reemphasize cytoskeletal architecture as a potential shared mechanism underlying symmetry breaking. However, convergent evolution remains a distinct possibility and study of a wider diversity of species will be needed to distinguish between conserved and lineage-specific mechanisms. genesis 52:458-470, 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were used to analyse the capability of C. parapsilosis cells to adhere and grow as biofilm on human natural substrates and to compare the adherence pattern of isolates exhibiting distinct phenotypes. Cells from the crepe phenotype are predominantly elongated and form pseudohyphae whereas cells from the smooth phenotype are yeast-shaped, either in liquid cultures or on human nail and hair surfaces. The electron micrographs revealed that C. parapsilosis cells from the smooth phenotype adhered in higher number to both surfaces compared to the observed for the crepe phenotype. SEM analysis of human hair surface revealed that cells from the smooth phenotype appear as clumped blastoconidia of uniform morphology embedded in a flocculent extracellular material forming biofilm. The extracellular material and biofilm were seeing in a less extension in the crepe phenotype. A distinct adherence pattern was observed when human nail was used as substrate. Here C. parapsilosis cells seem to be linked to surface structures of human nail plate. Fibrillar extracellular material was observed connecting neighbouring cells as well as nail surface. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The RIM101 pathway controls gene expression and the yeast-to-hyphal transition in C. albicans in response to changes in environmental pH in vitro. In this study, we found that the RIM101 pathway is necessary in vivo for pathogenesis. First, we show that rim101(-)/rim101(-) and rim8(-)/rim8(-) mutants have a significant reduction in virulence using the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated systemic candidiasis. Second, these mutants show a marked reduction in kidney pathology. Third, the rim101(-)/rim101(-) and rim8(-)/rim8(-) mutants show defects in the ability to damage endothelial cells in situ. Finally, we show that an activated allele of RIM101, RIM101-405, is a suppressor of the rim8(-) mutation in vivo as it rescues the virulence, histological, and endothelial damage defects of the rim8(-)/rim8(-) mutant. These results demonstrate that the RIM101 pathway is required for C. albicans virulence in vivo and that the function of Rim8p in pathogenesis is to activate Rim101p.},

The organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in these processes are regulated by Rho family small GTPases and kinase-phosphatase pathways. Moreover, membrane phospholipids, especially the phosphatidylinositol phosphates have emerged as important regulators of actin dynamics. From these, PI(4,5)P2 is the most abundant at the plasma membrane, and directly regulates the activities and subcellular localizations of numerous actin-binding proteins. Here, we discuss recent studies demonstrating that actin-binding proteins interact with PI(4,5)P2-rich membranes through drastically different affinities and dynamics correlating with their roles in cytoskeletal dynamics. Moreover, by using mesenchymal cell migration and clathrin-mediated endocytosis as examples, we present a model for how interplay between PI(4,5)P2 and actin-binding proteins control the actin cytoskeleton in cells.},

We report here that inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (Ipk1), which generates inositol hexakisphosphate, is critical for normal LR axis determination in zebrafish. Zebrafish embryos express ipk1 symmetrically during gastrulation and early segmentation. ipk1 knockdown by antisense morpholino oligonucleotide injection randomized LR-specific gene expression and organ placement, effects that were associated with reduced intracellular Ca2+ flux in cells surrounding the ciliated Kupffer's vesicle, a structure analogous to the mouse node. Our data suggest that the pathway for inositol hexakisphosphate production is a key regulator of asymmetric Ca2+ flux during LR specification. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

Outbreaks of C. parapsilosis infections have been caused by contamination of hyperalimentation solutions, intravascular pressure monitoring devices, and ophthalmic irrigating solution. Experimental studies have generally shown that C. parapsilosis is less virulent than Candida albicans or Candida tropicalis. However, characteristics of C. parapsilosis that may relate to its increasing occurrence in nosocomial settings include frequent colonization of the skin, particularly the subungual space, and an ability to proliferate in glucose-containing solutions, with a resultant increase in adherence to synthetic materials. Recently developed molecular techniques may facilitate the continued exploration of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of C. parapsilosis infections.},

Embryos mutant for the Notch ligand Dll1 or doubly mutant for the Notch1 and Notch2 receptors exhibit multiple defects in left-right asymmetry. Analysis of the enhancer regulating node-specific Nodal expression revealed the presence of binding sites for the RBP-J protein, the primary transcriptional mediator of Notch signaling. Mutation of these sites destroyed the ability of this enhancer to direct node-specific gene expression in transgenic mice. Our results demonstrate that Dll1-mediated Notch signaling is essential for generation of left-right asymmetry, and that the Notch pathway acts upstream of Nodal expression during left-right asymmetry determination in mice.},

The current paradigm of characterizing synthetic networks in cells results in lengthy design-build-test cycles, minimal data collection, and poor quantitative characterization. Cell-free systems are appealing alternative environments, but it remains questionable whether biological networks behave similarly in cell-free systems and in cells. We characterized in a cell-free system the ‘repressilator', a three-node synthetic oscillator. We then engineered novel three, four, and five-gene ring architectures, from characterization of circuit components to rapid analysis of complete networks. When implemented in cells, our novel 3-node networks produced population-wide oscillations and 95{\%} of 5-node oscillator cells oscillated for up to 72 hr. Oscillation periods in cells matched the cell-free system results for all networks tested. An alternate forward engineering paradigm using cell-free systems can thus accurately capture cellular behavior.},

However, it is not known how anterior-posterior information is translated into the posterior tilt of the node cilia. Here, we show that the basal body of node cilia is initially positioned centrally but then gradually shifts toward the posterior side of the node cells. Positioning of the basal body and unidirectional flow were found to be impaired in compound mutant mice lacking Dvl genes. Whereas the basal body was normally positioned in the node cells of Wnt3a-/- embryos, inhibition of Rac1, a component of the noncanonical Wnt signalling pathway, impaired the polarized localization of the basal body in wild-type embryos. Dvl2 and Dvl3 proteins were found to be localized to the apical side of the node cells, and their location was polarized to the posterior side of the cells before the posterior positioning of the basal body. These results suggest that posterior positioning of the basal body, which provides the posterior tilt to node cilia, is determined by planar polarization mediated by noncanonical Wnt signalling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We report for the first time that chromosome territories are maintained intact on the nuclear matrix. In contrast, complete extraction of the internal nuclear matrix components with RNase treatment followed by 2 M NaCl results in the disruption of higher order chromosome territory architecture. Correlative with territorial disruption is the formation of a faint DNA halo surrounding the nuclear lamina and a dispersive effect on the characteristically discrete DNA replication sites in the nuclear interior. Identical results were obtained using eight different human chromosome paints. Based on these findings, we developed a fractionation strategy to release the bulk of nuclear matrix proteins under conditions where the chromosome territories are maintained intact. A second treatment results in disruption of the chromosome territories in conjunction with the release of a small subset of acidic proteins. These proteins are distinct from the major nuclear matrix proteins and may be involved in mediating chromosome territory organization.},

abstract = {Directional left/right (LR) asymmetries, in which there are consistent, heritable differences in morphology between the left and right sides of bilaterally symmetrical organisms, are found in animals across the Bilateria. For many years, we have lacked evidence for shared mechanisms underlying their development. This led to the supposition that the mechanisms driving establishment of LR asymmetries, and consequently the asymmetries themselves, had evolved separately in the three major Superphyla that constitute the Bilateria. The recent discovery that the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) ligand Nodal plays a role in the regulation of LR asymmetry in both Deuterostomia and Lophotrochozoa has reignited debate in this field, as it suggests that at least this aspect of the development of the LR axis is conserved. In this review, we discuss evidence for shared mechanisms of LR asymmetry establishment across the bilaterian tree of life and consider how these mechanisms might have diverged across the Metazoa over the last 500 million years or so of evolution. As well as the likelihood that Nodal is an ancestral mechanism for regulating LR asymmetry, we reemphasize cytoskeletal architecture as a potential shared mechanism underlying symmetry breaking. However, convergent evolution remains a distinct possibility and study of a wider diversity of species will be needed to distinguish between conserved and lineage-specific mechanisms. genesis 52:458-470, 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {A surveillance program (SENTRY) of bloodstream infections (BSI) in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Europe from 1997 through 1999 detected 1,184 episodes of candidemia in 71 medical centers (32 in the United States, 23 in Europe, 9 in Latin America, and 7 in Canada). Overall, 55{\%} of the yeast BSIs were due to Candida albicans, followed by Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis (15{\%}), Candida tropicalis (9{\%}), and miscellaneous Candida spp. (6{\%}). In the United States, 45{\%} of candidemias were due to non-C. albicans species. C. glabrata (21{\%}) was the most common non-C. albicans species in the United States, and the proportion of non-C. albicans BSIs was highest in Latin America (55{\%}). C. albicans accounted for 60{\%} of BSI in Canada and 58{\%} in Europe. C. parapsilosis was the most common non-C. albicans species in Latin America (25{\%}), Canada (16{\%}), and Europe (17{\%}). Isolates of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis were all highly susceptible to fluconazole (97 to 100{\%} at {\textless} or =8 microg/ml). Likewise, 97 to 100{\%} of these species were inhibited by {\textless} or =1 microg/ml of ravuconazole (concentration at which 50{\%} were inhibited [MIC(50)], 0.007 to 0.03 microg/ml) or voriconazole (MIC(50), 0.007 to 0.06 microg/ml). Both ravuconazole and voriconazole were significantly more active than fluconazole against C. glabrata (MIC(90)s of 0.5 to 1.0 microg/ml versus 16 to 32 microg/ml, respectively). A trend of increased susceptibility of C. glabrata to fluconazole was noted over the three-year period. The percentage of C. glabrata isolates susceptible to fluconazole increased from 48{\%} in 1997 to 84{\%} in 1999, and MIC(50)s decreased from 16 to 4 microg/ml. A similar trend was documented in both the Americas (57 to 84{\%} susceptible) and Europe (22 to 80{\%} susceptible). Some geographic differences in susceptibility to triazole were observed with Canadian isolates generally more susceptible than isolates from the United States and Europe. These observations suggest susceptibility patterns and trends among yeast isolates from BSI and raise additional questions that can be answered only by continued surveillance and clinical investigations of the type reported here (SENTRY Program).},

abstract = {The detailed principles of the hierarchical folding of eukaryotic chromosomes have been revealed during the last two decades. Along with structures composing three-dimensional (3D) genome organization (chromatin compartments, topologically associating domains, chromatin loops, etc.), the molecular mechanisms that are involved in their establishment and maintenance have been characterized. Generally, protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions underlie the spatial genome organization in eukaryotes. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that weak interactions, which exist in biological systems, also contribute to the 3D genome. Here, we provide a snapshot of our current understanding of the role of the weak interactions in the establishment and maintenance of the 3D genome organization. We discuss how weak biological forces, such as entropic forces operating in crowded solutions, electrostatic interactions of the biomolecules, liquid-liquid phase separation, DNA supercoiling, and RNA environment participate in chromosome segregation into structural and functional units and drive intranuclear functional compartmentalization.},

@article{Schweickert2017,
abstract = {Laterality of inner organs is a wide-spread characteristic of vertebrates and beyond. It is ultimately controlled by the left-asymmetric activation of the Nodal signaling cascade in the lateral plate mesoderm of the neurula stage embryo, which results from a cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluids at the left-right organizer. This scenario is widely accepted for laterality determination in wildtype specimens. Deviations from this norm come in different flavors. At the level of organ morphogenesis, laterality may be inverted (situs inversus) or non-concordant with respect to the main body axis (situs ambiguus or heterotaxia). At the level of Nodal cascade gene activation, expression may be inverted, bilaterally induced, or absent. In a given genetic situation, patterns may be randomized or predominantly lacking laterality (absence or bilateral activation). We propose that the distributions of patterns observed may be indicative of the underlying molecular defects, with randomizations being primarily caused by defects in the flow-generating ciliary set-up, and symmetrical patterns being the result of impaired flow sensing, on the left, the right, or both sides. This prediction, the reasoning of which is detailed in this review, pinpoints functions of genes whose role in laterality determination have remained obscure.},

The enzyme showed high CO2 hydrase activity, with a kcat of 9.4×105s−1, and kcat/KM of 9.8×107M−1s−1. Simple benzenesulfonamides substituted in 2-, 4- and 3,4-positions of the benzene ring with amino, alkyl, halogeno and hydroxyalkyl moieties were weak scCA inhibitors with KIs in the range of 0.976–18.45$\mu$M. Better inhibition (KIs in the range of 154–654nM) was observed for benzenesulfonamides incorporating aminoalkyl/carboxyalkyl moieties or halogenosulfanilamides; benzene-1,3-disulfonamides; simple heterocyclic sulfonamides and sulfanilyl-sulfonamides. The clinically used sulfonamides/sulfamate (acetazolamide, ethoxzolamide, methazolamide, dorzolamide, topiramate, celecoxib, etc.) generally showed effective scCA inhibitory activity, with KIs in the range of 82.6–133nM. The best inhibitor (KI of 15.1nM) was 4-(2-amino-pyrimidin-4-yl)-benzenesulfonamide. These inhibitors may be useful to better understand the physiological role of $\beta$-CAs in yeast and some pathogenic fungi which encode orthologues of the yeast enzyme and eventually for designing novel antifungal therapies.},

With the exception of brush borders from intestinal epithelial cells, the arrowhead periodicity of decorated filaments in a variety of nonmuscle cells is similar to that in isolated myofibrils. The periodicity of decorated filaments in brush borders is significantly smaller. Actin filaments which attach to membranes display a clear, uniform polarity, with the S-I arrowheads pointing away from the plasma membrane, while those which comprise the stress fibers of myoblasts and CHO cells have antiparallel polarities. These observations are consistent with a sliding filament mechanism of cell motility. {\textcopyright} 1978, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Hedgehog cell-cell signaling pathway is crucial for animal development, and its misregulation is implicated in numerous birth defects and cancers. In unstimulated cells, pathway activity is inhibited by the tumor suppressor membrane protein, Patched. Hedgehog signaling is triggered by the secreted Hedgehog ligand, which binds and inhibits Patched, thus setting in motion the downstream events in signal transduction. Despite its critical importance, the mechanism by which Hedgehog antagonizes Patched has remained unknown. Here, we show that vertebrate Patched1 inhibition is caused by direct, palmitate-dependent interaction with the Sonic Hedgehog ligand. We find that a short palmitoylated N-terminal fragment of Sonic Hedgehog binds Patched1 and, strikingly, is sufficient to inhibit it and to activate signaling. The rest of Sonic Hedgehog confers high-affinity Patched1 binding and internalization through a distinct binding site, but, surprisingly, it is not absolutely required for signaling. The palmitate-dependent interaction with Patched1 is specifically impaired in a Sonic Hedgehog mutant causing human holoprosencephaly, the most frequent congenital brain malformation, explaining its drastically reduced potency. The palmitate-dependent interaction is also abolished in constitutively inhibited Patched1 point mutants causing the Gorlin cancer syndrome, suggesting that they might adopt a conformation distinct from the wild type. Our data demonstrate that Sonic Hedgehog signals via the palmitate-dependent arm of a two-pronged contact with Patched1. Furthermore, our results suggest that, during Hedgehog signaling, ligand binding inhibits Patched by trapping it in an inactive conformation, a mechanism that explains the dramatically reduced activity of oncogenic Patched1 mutants.},

abstract = {The internal organs of animals often have left-right asymmetry 1,2. Although the formation of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes in Drosophila is well understood, left-right asymmetry has not been extensively studied. Here we find that the handedness of the embryonic gut and the adult gut and testes is reversed (not randomized) in viable and fertile homozygous Myo31DF mutants. Myo31DF encodes an unconventional myosin, Drosophila MyoIA (also referred to as MyoID in mammals; refs 3, 4), and is the first actin-based motor protein to be implicated in left-right patterning. We find that Myo31DF is required in the hindgut epithelium for normal embryonic handedness. Disruption of actin filaments in the hindgut epithelium randomizes the handedness of the embryonic gut, suggesting that Myo31DF function requires the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, we find that Myo31DF colocalizes with the cytoskeleton. Overexpression of Myo61F, another myosin I (ref. 4), reverses the handedness of the embryonic gut, and its knockdown also causes a left-right patterning defect. These two unconventional myosin I proteins may have antagonistic functions in left-right patterning. We suggest that the actin cytoskeleton and myosin I proteins may be crucial for generating left-right asymmetry in invertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The effect of normal serum and serum for seven patients with disseminated candidiasis (DC) on candidacidal activity of normal human neutrophils (PMNL) was studied. PMNL incubated in DC serum had depressed candiacidal activity when compared to studies with normal serum. The candidacidal defect was not related to differences in particle uptake since phagocytic indices were similar with either normal or DC serum. DC serum did not affect PMNL bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus. When Candida albicans (CA) was incubated in either normal or DC sera, washed, and added to PMNL in normal serum, pronounced inhibition of candidacidal activity was seen in all studies with CA previously incubated in DC serum. Dilution of DC serum or absorption of DC serum with heat-killed CA reversed the candidacidal defect. Ultrastructural studies of phagocytized CA demonstrated small ("tight") phagolysosomes and a delay in breakdown of an electron-dense coating on CA previously incubated in DC serum when compared to controls. Inhibition of leukocyte candidacidal activity appeared to be related to high titers of IgG antibodies against CA present in DC serum.},

abstract = {Adaptation to the changing environmental CO2 levels is essential for all living cells. In particular, microorganisms colonizing and infecting the human body are exposed to highly variable concentrations, ranging from atmospheric 0.04 to 5{\%} and more in blood and specific host niches. Carbonic anhydrases are highly conserved metalloenzymes that enable fixation of CO2 by its conversion into bicarbonate. This process is not only crucial to ensure the supply of adequate carbon amounts for cellular metabolism, but also contributes to several signaling processes in fungi, including morphology and communication. The fungal specific carbonic anhydrase gene NCE103 is transcribed in response to CO2 availability. As recently shown, this regulation relies on the ATF/CREB transcription factor Cst6 and the AGC family protein kinase Sch9. Here, we review the regulatory mechanisms which control NCE103 expression in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata and discuss which additional factors might contribute in this novel CO2 sensing cascade.},

abstract = {DNA replication requires priming of DNA templates by enzymes known as primases. Although DNA primase structures are available from archaea and bacteria, the mechanism of DNA priming in higher eukaryotes remains poorly understood in large part due to the absence of the structure of the unique, highly conserved C-terminal regulatory domain of the large subunit (p58C). Here, we present the structure of this domain determined to 1.7-{\AA} resolution by X-ray crystallography. The p58C structure reveals a novel arrangement of an evolutionarily conserved 4Fe-4S cluster buried deeply within the protein core and is not similar to any known protein structure. Analysis of the binding of DNA to p58C by fluorescence anisotropy measurements revealed a strong preference for ss/ dsDNA junction substrates. This approach was combined with site-directed mutagenesis to confirm that the binding of DNA occurs to a distinctively basic surface on p58C. A specific interaction of p58C with the C-terminal domain of the intermediate subunit of replication protein A (RPA32C) was identified and characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR. Restraints from NMR experiments were used to drive computational docking of the two domains and generate a model of the p58C-RPA32C complex. Together, our results explain functional defects in human DNA primase mutants and provide insights into primosome loading on RPA-coated ssDNA and regulation of primase activity.},

Whether the same pathway also regulates left-right asymmetry in invertebrates and what is the evolutionary origin of the mechanisms controlling left-right determination are not known. Here, we show that nodal regulates left-right asymmetry in the sea urchin but that, intriguingly, its expression is reversed compared to vertebrates. Nodal signals emitted from the right side of the larva prevent the right coelomic pouch from forming the imaginal rudiment. Inhibition of Nodal signaling after gastrulation causes formation of an ectopic rudiment on the right side, leading to twinned urchins after metamorphosis. In contrast, ectopic activation of the pathway prevents formation of the rudiment. Our results show that the mechanisms responsible for left-right determination are conserved within basal deuterostomes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A left-right (LR) asymmetric body plan is crucial for the development of the human body. The past decade has seen rapid progress in our understanding of the LR symmetry-breaking process in vertebrate development. A series of experimental studies has demonstrated that leftward movement of fluid at the ventral node, designated nodal flow, is the central process in symmetry breaking. Nodal flow is autonomously generated by the posteriorly tilted rotation of cilia. The underlying fluid dynamic mechanism, especially the importance of viscous interactions between the cilia and the cell surface, has been clarified by theoretical analyses. Recent experiments have suggested how this leftward nodal flow can be interpreted to create LR asymmetry. Specifically, leftward transport of lipoprotein particles, called nodal vesicular parcels (NVPs), was uncovered. Nodal flow thus triggers left-specific signaling pathways by transporting signaling molecules to the left side using NVPs. Copyright ? 2009 by Annual Reviews. All right reserved.},

Conclusions from that are important for many synthetic procedures and include experimental and theoretical investigation (DFT calculations) of such metal mediated processes in the condensed and in the gas phase in which the zinc cation plays a dominant role. This is extended to the bio-analogue activation of further heterocumulenes such as COS, an important atmospheric trace gas, and CS(2). Novel metal complexes which serve as useful catalysts for the reactions (copolymerisations and cyclisation) of CO(2) and oxiranes are discussed subject to the inclusion of recently published DFT calculations. We continue with the discussion of the very general aspect of the insertion of CO(2) into metal-nitrogen bonds (formation of carbamates). This again is closely related to many biological or bio-analogue processes. We describe the synthesis and mechanistic aspects of characteristic metal carbamates of a wide variety of metals and include a discussion of the mechanistic aspects, especially for the formation of Mg(2+) and Li(+) carbamates and the formation of related cyclic products after addition of the heterocumulenes CO(2), Ph-NCO or CS(2) to novel ligands, the 4H-pyridin-1-ides which finally result in the formation of e.g. 1,3-thiazole-5(2H)-thiones.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design' may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

The Hh signal is transduced by the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo); however, the mechanism by which Smo is regulated remains largely unknown. Here we show that protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase I (CKI) regulate Smo cell-surface accumulation and activity in response to Hh. Blocking PKA or CKI activity in the Drosophila wing disc prevents Hh-induced Smo accumulation and attenuates pathway activity, whereas increasing PKA activity promotes Smo accumulation and pathway activation. We show that PKA and CKI phosphorylate Smo at several sites, and that phosphorylation-deficient forms of Smo fail to accumulate on the cell surface and are unable to transduce the Hh signal. Conversely, phosphorylation-mimicking Smo variants show constitutive cell-surface expression and signalling activity. Furthermore, we find that the levels of Smo cell-surface expression and activity correlate with its levels of phosphorylation. Our data indicate that Hh induces progressive Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CKI, leading to elevation of Smo cell-surface levels and signalling activity.},

A detailed mathematical analysis of the dynamical behavior is provided for two model systems: (i) a repressilator with leaky transcription and single-step cooperative repressor binding, and (ii) a repressilator with auto-activation and cooperative regulator binding. Genes are assumed to be present in constant amounts, transcription and translation are modelled by single-step kinetics, and mRNAs as well as proteins are assumed to be degraded by first order reactions. Several dynamical patterns are observed: multiple steady states, periodic and aperiodic oscillations corresponding to limit cycles and heteroclinic cycles, respectively. The results of computer simulations are complemented by a detailed and complete stability analysis of all equilibria and of the heteroclinic cycle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer.},

Both the toxicity of filipin and the therapeutic value of amphotericin B can be rationalized at the cellular and molecular level by the following observations: (i) these polyene antibiotics showed differential effects on cells; filipin was more potent in lysing human red blood cells, whereas amphotericin B was more potent in inhibiting yeast cell growth; and (ii) the effects of filipin were more efficiently inhibited by added cholesterol, the major membrane sterol in human cells, whereas the effects of amphotericin B were more efficiently inhibited by ergosterol, the major membrane sterol in yeast. The simplest inference is that the toxicity and effectiveness of polyenes are determined by their relative avidities for the predominant sterol in cell membranes.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen whose virulence is related to its ability to switch between yeast, pseudohyphal, and true-hyphal morphologies. To ask how long-distance nuclear migration occurs in C. albicans hyphae, we identified the fundamental properties of nuclear movements and microtubule dynamics using time-lapse microscopy. In hyphae, nuclei migrate to, and divide across, the presumptive site of septation, which forms 10 to 15 microm distal to the basal cell. The mother nucleus returns to the basal cell, while the daughter nucleus reiterates the process. We used time-lapse microscopy to identify the mechanisms by which C. albicans nuclei move over long distances and are coordinated with hyphal morphology. We followed nuclear migration and spindle dynamics, as well as the time and position of septum specification, defined it as the presumptum, and established a chronology of nuclear, spindle, and morphological events. Analysis of microtubule dynamics revealed that premitotic forward nuclear migration is due to the repetitive sliding of astral microtubules along the cell cortex but that postmitotic forward and reverse nuclear migrations are due primarily to spindle elongation. Free microtubules exhibit cell cycle regulation; they are present during interphase and disappear at the time of spindle assembly. Finally, a growth defect in strains expressing Tub2-green fluorescent protein revealed a connection between hyphal elongation and the nuclear cell cycle that is coordinated by hyphal length and/or volume.},

A major goal in the field is to understand how embryos initially determine their left and right hand sides, a process known as symmetry breaking. A number of recent studies on several vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms have provided a more complex view on how L/R asymmetry is established, revealing an apparent partition between deuterostomes and protostomes. In deuterostomes, nodal cilia represent a conserved symmetry-breaking process; nevertheless, growing evidence shows the existence of pre-cilia L/R asymmetries involving active ion flows. In protostomes like snails and Drosophila, symmetry breaking relies on different mechanisms, involving, in particular, the actin cytoskeleton and associated molecular motors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report that Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a function upstream of Nodal signaling to regulate LR patterning in zebrafish. Knocking down Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a activity in dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs), which are precursors of Kupffer's vesicle (KV), is sufficient to disrupt asymmetric gene expression in the lateral plate mesoderm and randomize the placement of internal organs, indicating that the activity of Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a in DFCs/KV is crucial for LR patterning. High-speed videomicroscopy and bead implantation experiments show that KV cilia are immobile and the directional fluid flow in KV is abolished in Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a morphants, suggesting their essential role in KV ciliary function. Furthermore, we found that intracellular Ca2+ levels are elevated in Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a morphants and that the defects in ciliary motility, KV fluid flow and placement of internal organs induced by their knockdown could be suppressed by inhibiting the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Together, our data demonstrate that Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$2 and Ncx4a regulate LR patterning by modulating intracellular calcium levels in KV and by influencing cilia function, revealing a previously unrecognized role for calcium signaling in LR patterning.},

The signaling protein Nodal is key for determining this laterality. Many vertebrates, including humans, use cilia for breaking symmetry during embryonic development: Rotating cilia produce a leftward flow of extracellular fluids that induces the asymmetric expression of Nodal. By contrast, Nodal asymmetry can be induced flow-independently in invertebrates. Here, we ask when and why flow evolved. We propose that flow was present at the base of the deuterostomes and that it is required to maintain organ asymmetry in otherwise perfectly bilaterally symmetrical vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2014.

These effects, which are driven by complex regulatory networks linking metabolism, morphogenesis, stress adaptation, and cell wall remodelling, influence commensalism and infection. Therefore, current concepts of Candida-host interactions must be extended to include the impact of metabolic adaptation upon pathogenicity and immunogenicity.},

abstract = {Many replication initiators form higher-order oligomers that process host replication origins to promote replisome formation. In addition to dedicated duplex-DNA-binding domains, cellular initiators possess AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) elements that drive functions ranging from protein assembly to origin recognition. In bacteria, the AAA+ domain of the initiator DnaA has been proposed to assist in single-stranded DNA formation during origin melting. Here we show crystallographically and in solution that the ATP-dependent assembly of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA into a spiral oligomer creates a continuous surface that allows successive AAA+ domains to bind and extend single-stranded DNA segments. The mechanism of binding is unexpectedly similar to that of RecA, a homologous recombination factor, but it differs in that DnaA promotes a nucleic acid conformation that prevents pairing of a complementary strand. These findings, combined with strand-displacement assays, indicate that DnaA opens replication origins by a direct ATP-dependent stretching mechanism. Comparative studies reveal notable commonalities between the approach used by DnaA to engage DNA substrates and other, nucleic-acid-dependent, AAA+ systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The vectors facilitate propagation and expression of cloned genes in C. parapsilosis cells and allow intracellular localization of gene products and/or monitoring the activity of promoter sequences.},

In order to evade or counteract attack by phagocytes, pathogenic yeasts have acquired a repertoire of strategies to survive, colonize and infect the host. In this review we focus on the interaction of yeasts, such as Candida, Histoplasma or Cryptococcus species, with macrophages or neutrophils. We discuss strategies used by these fungi to prevent phagocytosis or to counteract phagocytic activities. We go on to describe the strategies that permit intracellular survival within phagocytes and that may eventually lead to damage of and escape from the phagocyte.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, most inner organs are asymmetrically arranged with respect to the main body axis [1]. Symmetry breakage in fish, amphibian, and mammalian embryos depends on cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluid during neurulation [2-5]. Flow induces the asymmetric nodal cascade that governs asymmetric organ morphogenesis and placement [1, 6, 7]. In the frog Xenopus, an alternative laterality-generating mechanism involving asymmetric localization of serotonin at the 32-cell stage has been proposed [8]. However, no functional linkage between this early localization and flow at neurula stage has emerged. Here, we report that serotonin signaling is required for specification of the superficial mesoderm (SM), which gives rise to the ciliated gastrocoel roof plate (GRP) where flow occurs [5, 9]. Flow and asymmetry were lost in embryos in which serotonin signaling was downregulated. Serotonin, which we found uniformly distributed along the main body axes in the early embryo, was required for Wnt signaling, which provides the instructive signal to specify the GRP. Importantly, serotonin was required for Wnt-induced double-axis formation as well. Our data confirm flow as primary mechanism of symmetry breakage and suggest a general role of serotonin as competence factor for Wnt signaling during axis formation in Xenopus. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These switches are normally tightly controlled, but in RAS-related diseases, such as cancer, RASopathies, and many psychiatric disorders, mutations in the RAS genes or their regulators render RAS proteins persistently active. The structural basis of the switch and many of the pathways that RAS controls are well known, but the precise mechanisms by which RAS proteins function are less clear. All RAS biology occurs in membranes: a precise understanding of RAS' interaction with membranes is essential to understand RAS action and to intervene in RAS-driven diseases.},

abstract = {Upf1 is a highly conserved RNA helicase essential for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an mRNA quality-control mechanism that degrades aberrant mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (PTCs). For the activation of NMD, UPF1 interacts first with a translation-terminating ribosome and then with a downstream exon-junction complex (EJC), which is deposited at exon-exon junctions during splicing. Although the helicase activity of Upf1 is indispensable for NMD, its roles and substrates have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we show that stable RNA secondary structures between a PTC and a downstream exon-exon junction increase the levels of potential NMD substrates. We also demonstrate that a stable secondary structure within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) induces the binding of Upf1 to mRNA in a translation-dependent manner and that the Upf1-related molecules are accumulated at the 5′-side of such a structure. Furthermore, we present evidence that the helicase activity of Upf1 is used to bridge the spatial gap between a translation-termination codon and a downstream exon-exon junction for the activation of NMD. Based on these findings, we propose a model that the Upf1-related molecular motor scans the 3′-UTR in the 5′-to-3′ direction for the mRNA-binding factors including EJCs to ensure mRNA integrity. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The degree of conservation among phyla of early mechanisms that pattern the left-right (LR) axis is poorly understood. Larvae of sea urchins exhibit consistently oriented LR asymmetry. The main part of the adult rudiment is formed from the left coelomic sac of larvae, the left hydrocoel. Although this left preference is conserved among all echinoderm larvae, its mechanism is largely not understood. Using two marker genes, HpNot and HpFoxFQ-like, which are asymmetrically expressed during larval development of the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, we examined in this study the possibility that the recently discovered ion flux mechanism controls asymmetry in sea urchins as it does in several vertebrate species. Several ion-transporter inhibitors were screened for the ability to alter the expression of the asymmetric marker genes. Blockers of the H+/K+-ATPase (omeprazole, lansoprazole and SCH28080), as well as a calcium ionophore (A23187), significantly altered the normal sidedness of asymmetric gene expression. Exposure to omeprazole disrupted the consistent asymmetry of adult rudiment formation in larvae. Immuno-detection revealed that H+/K+-ATPase-like antigens in sea urchin embryos were present through blastula stage and exhibited a striking asymmetry being present in a single blastomere in 32-cell embryos. These results suggest that, as in vertebrates, endogenous spatially-regulated early transport of H+ and/or K+, and also of Ca2+, functions in the establishment of LR asymmetry in sea urchin development. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Left-right (L-R) asymmetry in the mouse embryo is generated in the node and is dependent on cilia-driven fluid flow, but how the initial asymmetry is transmitted from the node to the lateral plate has remained unknown. We have now identified a transcriptional enhancer (ANE) in the human LEFTY1 gene that exhibits marked L. {\textgreater} R asymmetric activity in perinodal cells of the mouse embryo. Dissection of ANE revealed that it is activated in the perinodal cells on the left side by Nodal signaling, suggesting that Nodal activity in the node is asymmetric at a time when Nodal expression is symmetric. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2) indeed manifested an L-R asymmetric distribution at the node, being detected in perinodal cells preferentially on the left side. This asymmetry in pSmad2 distribution was found to be generated not by unidirectional transport of Nodal but rather as a result of L {\textless} R asymmetric expression of the Nodal antagonist Cerl2. For various mutant embryos examined, the asymmetry in pSmad2 distribution among the perinodal cells closely matched that in lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). However, autocrine-paracrine Nodal signaling in perinodal cells is dispensable for L-R patterning of LPM, given that its inhibition by expression of dominant negative forms of Smad3 or ALK4 was still associated with normal (left-sided) Nodal expression in LPM. Our results suggest that LPM is the direct target of Nodal secreted by the perinodal cells, and that an L {\textgreater} R distribution of active Nodal in the node is translated into the asymmetry in LPM. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

After Spemann's organizer and its derivatives have endowed the neural plate with a coarse pattern along its anteroposterior and mediolateral axes, this basis is progressively refined by the activity of secondary organizers within the neuroepithelium that function by releasing diffusible signaling factors. Dorsoventral patterning is mediated by two organizer regions that extend along the dorsal and ventral midlines of the entire neuraxis, whereas anteroposterior patterning is controlled by several discrete organizers. Here we review how these secondary organizers are established and how they exert their signaling functions. Organizer signals come from a surprisingly limited set of signaling factor families, indicating that the competence of target cells to respond to those signals plays an important part in neural patterning.},

CAs have been identified in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and can be classified into five groups ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\zeta$) that are unrelated in sequence and structure. The fungal $\beta$-class has only recently attracted attention. In the present study, we investigated the structure and function of the plant-like $\beta$-CA proteins CAS1 and CAS2 from the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora. We demonstrated that both proteins can substitute for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae $\beta$-CA Nce103 and exhibit an in vitro CO2 hydration activity (kcat /Km of CAS1: 1.30 × 10(6)  m(-1) {\textperiodcentered}s(-1) ; CAS2: 1.21 × 10(6 ) m(-1) {\textperiodcentered}s(-1) ). To further investigate the structural properties of CAS1 and CAS2, we determined their crystal structures to a resolution of 2.7 {\AA} and 1.8 {\AA}, respectively. The oligomeric state of both proteins is tetrameric. With the exception of the active site composition, no further major differences have been found. In both enzymes, the Zn(2) (+)  -ion is tetrahedrally coordinated; in CAS1 by Cys45, His101 and Cys104 and a water molecule and in CAS2 by the side chains of four residues (Cys56, His112, Cys115 and Asp58).

Although the asymmetric Nodal cascade is conserved in all vertebrates, the mechanism of symmetry breakage has remained controversial [3]. In mammalian and fish embryos, a cilia-driven leftward flow of extracellular fluid is required for initiation of the Nodal cascade. This flow is localized at the posterior notochord ("node") and Kupffer's vesicle, respectively [4-7]. In frog and chick embryos, however, molecular asymmetries are required earlier, from cleavage stages through gastrulation [8, 9]. The validity of a cilia-based mechanism for all vertebrates therefore has been questioned [3]. Here we show that a cilia-driven leftward flow precedes asymmetric nodal expression in the frog Xenopus. Motile monocilia emerged on the gastrocoel roof plate during neurulation and lengthened and polarized from an initially central position to the posterior pole of cells. Concomitantly, a robust leftward fluid flow developed from stage 15 onward, significantly before asymmetric nodal transcription started in the left-lateral-plate mesoderm at stage 19. Injection of 1.5{\%} methylcellulose into the archenteron prevented leftward flow and resulted in laterality defects, demonstrating that the flow itself was required for asymmetric gene expression and organ placement. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin, but the mechanisms by which they localize to genomic targets remain unexplored. We investigated the localization mechanisms of the Xist lncRNA during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation. During the maintenance of XCI, Xist binds broadly across the X chromosome. During initiation of XCI, Xist initially transfers to distal regions across the X chromosome that are not defined by specific sequences. Instead, Xist identifies these regions by exploiting the three-dimensional conformation of the X chromosome. Xist requires its silencing domain to spread across actively transcribed regions and thereby access the entire chromosome. These findings suggest a model in which Xist coats the X chromosome by searching in three dimensions, modifying chromosome structure, and spreading to newly accessible locations.},

abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {Ptd(4,5)P2 is thought to promote and organize a wide range of cellular functions, including vesicular membrane traffic and cytoskeletal dynamics, by recruiting functional protein complexes to restricted locations in cellular membranes. However, little is known about the distribution of Ptdlns(4,5)P2 in the cell at high resolution. We have used the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase $\delta$1 (PLC$\delta$1), narrowly specific for PtdIns(4,5)P2, to map the distribution of the lipid in astrocytoma and A431 cells. We applied the glutathione S-transferase-tagged PLC$\delta$1 PH domain (PLC$\delta$1PH-GST) in an on-section labelling approach which avoids transfection procedures. Here we demonstrate Ptdlns(4,5)P2 labelling in the plasma membrane, and also in intracellular membranes, including Golgi (mainly stack), endosomes and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as in electron-dense structures within the nucleus. At the plasma membrane, labelling was more concentrated over lamellipodia, but not in caveolae, which contained less than 10{\%} of the total cell-surface labelling. A dramatic decrease in signal over labelled compartments was observed on preincubation with the cognate headgroup [Ins(1,4,5)P3], and plasma-membrane labelling was substantially decreased after stimulation with thrombin-receptor-activating peptide (SFLLRN in the one-letter amino acid code), a treatment which markedly diminishes Ptdlns(4,5)P2 levels. Thus we have developed a highly selective method for mapping the PtdIns(4,5)P2 distribution within cells at high resolution, and our data provide direct evidence for this lipid at key functional locations.},

abstract = {The Z mutation (E342K) of $\alpha$1-antitrypsin ($\alpha$1-AT), carried by 4{\%} of Northern Europeans, predisposes to early onset of emphysema due to decreased functional $\alpha$1-AT in the lung and to liver cirrhosis due to accumulation of polymers in hepatocytes. However, it remains unclear why the Z mutation causes intracellular polymerization of nascent Z $\alpha$1-AT and why 15{\%} of the expressed Z $\alpha$1-AT is secreted into circulation as functional, but polymerogenic, monomers. Here, we solve the crystal structure of the Z-monomer and have engineered replacements to assess the conformational role of residue Glu-342 in $\alpha$1-AT. The results reveal that Z$\alpha$1-AT has a labile strand 5 of the central $\beta$-sheet A (s5A) with a consequent equilibrium between a native inhibitory conformation, as in its crystal structure here, and an aberrant conformation with s5A only partially incorporated into the central $\beta$-sheet. This aberrant conformation, induced by the loss of interactions from the Glu-342 side chain, explains why Z $\alpha$1-AT is prone to polymerization and readily binds to a 6-mer peptide, and it supports that annealing of s5A into the central $\beta$-sheet is a crucial step in the serpins' metastable conformational formation. The demonstration that the aberrant conformation can be rectified through stabilization of the labile s5A by binding of a small molecule opens a potential therapeutic approach for Z $\alpha$1-AT deficiency.},

abstract = {The ascomycete Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in immunocompromised patients . Its ability to change morphology, from yeast to filamentous forms, in response to host environmental cues is important for virulence . Filamentation is mediated by second messengers such as cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) synthesized by adenylyl cyclase . The distantly related basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that predominantly infects the central nervous system in immunocompromised patients . Similar to the morphological change in C. albicans, capsule biosynthesis in C. neoformans, a major virulence attribute, is also dependent upon adenylyl cyclase activity . Here we demonstrate that physiological concentrations of CO2/HCO3- induce filamentation in C. albicans by direct stimulation of cyclase activity. Furthermore, we show that CO2/HCO3- equilibration by carbonic anhydrase is essential for pathogenesis of C. albicans in niches where the available CO2 is limited. We also demonstrate that adenylyl cyclase from C. neoformans is sensitive to physiological concentrations of CO2/HCO3-. These data demonstrate that the link between cAMP signaling and CO2/HCO3- sensing is conserved in fungi and reveal CO2 sensing to be an important mediator of fungal pathogenesis. Novel therapeutic agents could target this pathway at several levels to control fungal infections.},

This led to the inference that both daughter strands of chromosomal DNA grow continuously, the direction of synthesis being 5' to 3' on one strand and 3' to 5' on the other (Fig. 1A). This mechanism of continuous chain growth, however, conflicts with the fact that the in vitro DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction (Kornberg, 1960; Mitra and Romberg, 1966)...},

abstract = {Breaking left-right symmetry in Bilateria embryos is a major event in body plan organization that leads to polarized adult morphology, directional organ looping, and heart and brain function1-4. However, the molecular nature of the determinant(s) responsible for the invariant orientation of the left-right axis (situs choice) remains largely unknown. Mutations producing a complete reversal of left-right asymmetry (situs inversus) are instrumental for identifying mechanisms controlling handedness, yet only one such mutation has been found in mice (inversin)5 and snails6,7. Here we identify the conserved type ID unconventional myosin 31DF gene (Myo31DF) as a unique situs inversus locus in Drosophila. Myo31DF mutations reverse the dextral looping of genitalia, a prominent left-right marker in adult flies. Genetic mosaic analysis pinpoints the A8 segment of the genital disc as a left-right organizer and reveals an anterior-posterior compartmentalization of Myo31DF function that directs dextral development and represses a sinistral default state. As expected of a determinant, Myo31DF has a trigger-like function and is expressed symmetrically in the organizer, and its symmetrical overexpression does not impair left-right asymmetry. Thus Myo31DF is a dextral gene with actin-based motor activity controlling situs choice. Like mouse inversin 8, Myo31DF interacts and colocalizes with $\beta$-catenin, suggesting that situs inversus genes can direct left-right development through the adherens junction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

This laterality is important for normal body function, as alterations manifest as numerous human birth defect syndromes.The left-right axis is set up very early during embryogenesis by an initial and still poorly understood break in bilateral symmetry, followed by a cascade of molecular events that was discovered 20 years ago in the chick embryo model. This gene regulatory network leads to activation of the pitx2 gene on the left side of the embryo which ultimately establishes asymmetric organogenesis of the heart, gut, brain, and other organs. In this review, we highlight the crucial contributions of the avian model to the discovery of the differential transcriptional cascades operating on the Left and Right sides, as well as to the physiological events operating upstream of asymmetric gene expression. The chick was not only instrumental in the discovery of mechanisms behind left-right patterning, but stands poised to facilitate inroads into the most fundamental aspects that link asymmetry to the rest of evolutionary developmental biology.},

METHODS Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance [SCOPE]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial BSIs. RESULTS Our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial BSI in 49 US hospitals over a 7-year period from March 1995 through September 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Eighty-seven percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-positive organisms caused 65{\%} of these BSIs, gram-negative organisms caused 25{\%}, and fungi caused 9.5{\%}. The crude mortality rate was 27{\%}. The most-common organisms causing BSIs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (31{\%} of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20{\%}), enterococci (9{\%}), and Candida species (9{\%}). The mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with Escherichia coli, 16 days for S. aureus, 22 days for Candida species and Klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for Acinetobacter species. CoNS, Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (P{\textless}.001). In neutropenic patients, infections with Candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. The proportion of S. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22{\%} in 1995 to 57{\%} in 2001 (P{\textless}.001, trend analysis). Vancomycin resistance was seen in 2{\%} of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60{\%} of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION In this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial BSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in US hospitals.},

abstract = {Pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis possess a {\ss}-type carbonic anhydrase Nce103p, which is involved in CO2 hydration and signaling. C. albicans lacking Nce103p cannot survive in low CO2 concentrations, e.g., in atmospheric growth conditions. Candida carbonic anhydrases are orthologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzyme, which had originally been detected as a substrate of a non-classical export pathway. However, experimental evidence on localization of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis carbonic anhydrases has not been reported to date. Immunogold labeling and electron microscopy used in the present study showed that carbonic anhydrases are localized in the cell wall and plasmatic membrane of both Candida species. This localization was confirmed by Western blot and mass spectrometry analyses of isolated cell wall and plasma membrane fractions. Further analysis of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis subcellular fractions revealed presence of carbonic anhydrases also in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of Candida cells cultivated in shaken liquid cultures, under the atmospheric conditions.},

abstract = {The age-associated decline in immune function, referred to as immunosenescence, is well characterised within the adaptive immune system, and in particular, among T cells. Hallmarks of immunosenescence measured in the T cell pool, include low numbers and proportions of na{\"{i}}ve cells, high numbers and proportions of late-stage differentiated effector memory cells, poor proliferative responses to mitogens, and a CD4:CD8 ratio {\textless}1.0. These changes are largely driven by infection with Cytomegalovirus, which has been directly linked with increased inflammatory activity, poor responses to vaccination, frailty, accelerated cognitive decline, and early mortality. It has been suggested however, that exercise might exert an anti-immunosenescence effect, perhaps delaying the onset of immunological ageing or even rejuvenating aged immune profiles. This theory has been developed on the basis of evidence that exercise is a powerful stimulus of immune function. For example, in vivo antibody responses to novel antigens can be improved with just minutes of exercise undertaken at the time of vaccination. Further, lymphocyte immune-surveillance, whereby cells search tissues for antigens derived from viruses, bacteria, or malignant transformation, is thought to be facilitated by the transient lymphocytosis and subsequent lymphocytopenia induced by exercise bouts. Moreover, some forms of exercise are anti-inflammatory, and if repeated regularly over the lifespan, there is a lower morbidity and mortality from diseases with an immunological and inflammatory aetiology. The aim of this article is to discuss recent theories for how exercise might influence T cell immunosenescence, exploring themes in the context of hotly debated issues in immunology.},

abstract = {The field of left-right (LR) patterning - the study of molecular mechanisms that yield directed morphological asymmetries in otherwise symmetrical organisms - is in disarray. On one hand is the undeniably elegant hypothesis that rotary beating of inclined cilia is the primary symmetry-breaking step: they create an asymmetric extracellular flow across the embryonic midline. On the other hand lurk many early symmetry-breaking steps that, even in some vertebrates, precede the onset of ciliary flow. We highlight an intracellular model of LR patterning where gene expression is initiated by physiological asymmetries that arise from subcellular asymmetries (e.g. motor-protein function along oriented cytoskeletal tracks). A survey of symmetry breaking in eukaryotes ranging from protists to vertebrates suggests that intracellular cytoskeletal elements are ancient and primary LR cues. Evolutionarily, quirky effectors like ciliary motion were likely added later in vertebrates. In some species (like mice), developmentally earlier cues may have been abandoned entirely. Late-developing asymmetries pose a challenge to the intracellular model, but early mid-plane determination in many groups increases its plausibility. Multiple experimental tests are possible. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Here we quantitatively analyze and compare the 3D structures of two types of genomic domains as defined by the human transcriptome map. While ridges are gene dense and show high expression levels, antiridges, on the other hand, are gene poor and carry genes that are expressed at low levels. We show that ridges are in general less condensed, more irregularly shaped, and located more closely to the nuclear center than antiridges. Six human cell lines that display different gene expression patterns and karyotypes share these structural parameters of chromatin. This shows that the chromatin structures of these two types of genomic domains are largely independent of tissue-specific variations in gene expression and differentiation state. Moreover, we show that there is remarkably little intermingling of chromatin from different parts of the same chromosome in a chromosome territory, neither from adjacent nor from distant parts. This suggests that the chromosomal fiber has a compact structure that sterically suppresses intermingling. Together, our results reveal novel general aspects of 3D chromosome architecture that are related to genome structure and function.},

abstract = {The NCE103 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a CA (carbonic anhydrase) that catalyses the interconversion of CO2 and bicarbonate. It has previously been reported that nce103 null mutants require elevated CO2 concentrations for growth in batch cultures. To discriminate between 'sparking' effects of CO2 and a CO2 requirement for steady-state fermentative growth, we switched glucose-limited anaerobic chemostat cultures of an nce103 null mutant from sparging with pure CO2 to sparging with nitrogen gas. This switch resulted in wash-out of the biomass, demonstrating that elevated CO2 concentrations are required even under conditions where CO2 is produced at high rates by fermentative sugar metabolism. Nutritional analysis of the nce103 null mutant demonstrated that growth on glucose under a non-CO2-enriched nitrogen atmosphere was possible when the culture medium was provided with L-aspartate, fatty acids, uracil and L-argininine. Thus the main physiological role of CA during growth of S. cerevisiae on glucose-ammonium salts media is the provision of inorganic carbon for the bicarbonate-dependent carboxylation reactions catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and CPSase (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase). To our knowledge, the present study represents the first full determination of the nutritional requirements of a CA-negative organism to date.},

abstract = {Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are metalloenzymes that catalyze the interconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen carbonate. CAs are distributed over all the three domains of life and are divided into five distinct evolutionarily unrelated gene families ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\zeta$). In the large fungal kingdom, the majority of fungi encode multiple copies of $\beta$-CAs, with some also possessing genes for $\alpha$-class CAs. Hemiascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts encode one or two $\beta$-CAs, while most of the filamentous ascomycetes have multiple copies of genes encoding $\alpha$- and $\beta$-CAs. The functions of fungal $\beta$-CAs have been investigated intensively, while the role of fungal $\alpha$-CAs is mostly unknown. The $\beta$-CAs are involved in sexual development, CO2-sensing, pathogenicity, and survival in ambient air. Only recently, researchers have begun to use functional and structural data of CAs from pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms to develop powerful and effective drugs and inhibitors or to identify enzymes that can be utilized in industrial applications. Despite the large number of fungal CAs known, only five have been characterized structurally: the $\alpha$-CA AoCA of Aspergillus oryzae, the full length $\beta$-CA Can2 from the pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, the N-terminally truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae $\beta$-CA Nce103, and two $\beta$-CAs of Sordaria macrospora. This review focuses on the functional and structural properties of fungal CAs.},

abstract = {Like many organisms the fungal pathogen Candida albicans senses changes in the environmental CO(2) concentration. This response involves two major proteins: adenylyl cyclase and carbonic anhydrase (CA). Here, we demonstrate that CA expression is tightly controlled by the availability of CO(2) and identify the bZIP transcription factor Rca1p as the first CO(2) regulator of CA expression in yeast. We show that Rca1p upregulates CA expression during contact with mammalian phagocytes and demonstrate that serine 124 is critical for Rca1p signaling, which occurs independently of adenylyl cyclase. ChIP-chip analysis and the identification of Rca1p orthologs in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cst6p) point to the broad significance of this novel pathway in fungi. By using advanced microscopy we visualize for the first time the impact of CO(2) build-up on gene expression in entire fungal populations with an exceptional level of detail. Our results present the bZIP protein Rca1p as the first fungal regulator of carbonic anhydrase, and reveal the existence of an adenylyl cyclase independent CO(2) sensing pathway in yeast. Rca1p appears to regulate cellular metabolism in response to CO(2) availability in environments as diverse as the phagosome, yeast communities or liquid culture.},

abstract = {Diet affects both lifespan and reproduction [1-9], leading to the prediction that the contrasting reproductive strategies of the sexes should result in sex-specific effects of nutrition on fitness and longevity [6, 10] and favor different patterns of nutrient intake in males and females. However, males and females share most of their genome and intralocus sexual conflict may prevent sex-specific diet optimization. We show that both male and female longevity were maximized on a high-carbohydrate low-protein diet in field crickets Teleogryllus commodus, but male and female lifetime reproductive performances were maximized in markedly different parts of the nutrient intake landscape. Given a choice, crickets exhibited sex-specific dietary preference in the direction that increases reproductive performance, but this sexual dimorphism in preference was incomplete, with both sexes displaced from the optimum diet for lifetime reproduction. Sexes are, therefore, constrained in their ability to reach their sex-specific dietary optima by the shared biology of diet choice. Our data suggest that sex-specific selection has thus far failed fully to resolve intralocus sexual conflict over diet optimization. Such conflict may be an important factor linking nutrition and reproduction to lifespan and aging. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vertebrates exhibit striking left–right (L–R) asymmetries in the structure and position of the internal organs. Symmetry is broken by motile cilia-generated asymmetric fluid flow, resulting in a signaling cascade – the Nodal–Pitx2 pathway – being robustly established within mesodermal tissue on the left side only. This pathway impinges upon various organ primordia to instruct their side-specific development. Recently, progress has been made in understanding both the breaking of embryonic L–R symmetry and how the Nodal–Pitx2 pathway controls lateralized cell differentiation, migration, and other aspects of cell behavior, as well as tissue-level mechanisms, that drive asymmetries in organ formation. Proper execution of asymmetric organogenesis is critical to health, making furthering our understanding of L–R development an important concern. Gut looping morphogenesis depends on Nodal–Pitx2 pathway-induced changes to the cellular architecture of the dorsal mesentery coupled with physical forces imparted on the gut by the dorsal mesentery. In zebrafish, gut asymmetries are driven by asymmetric migration of the lateral plate mesoderm, which pushes the gut tube away from the midline. Early cardiac asymmetries depend on Nodal signaling-induced asymmetries in cardiac progenitor cell migration. Cardiac looping asymmetry is driven by forces intrinsic to the heart but made robust by external Nodal pathway cues. Asymmetric migration of the parapineal in the zebrafish brain is achieved by an integration of FGF and Nodal signals, which drive migration and bias the direction, respectively.},

This cell polarity is reflected in the direction of the structures nucleated around each basal body such as the ciliary rootlets. Studies in these ciliates showed that basal bodies assemble two types of cilia, the cortical cilia and the cilia of the oral apparatus, a complex structure specialized in food capture. These two cilia types display structural differences at their tip domain. Basal bodies possessing distinct compositions creating specialized landmarks are also present. Cilia might be expected to express and transmit polarities throughout signaling pathways given their recognized role in signal transduction. This review will focus on how local polarities in basal bodies/cilia are regulated and transmitted through cell division in order to maintain the global polarity and shape of these cells and locally constrain the interpretation of signals by different cilia. We will also discuss ciliates as excellent biological models to study development and morphogenetic mechanisms and their relationship with cilia diversity and function in metazoans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in birds is important for public health. Faecal droppings from wild-birds are more readily available for such studies, but the inability to identify the species-origin of faecal samples limits their value. OBJECTIVES: To develop, optimise, and field-test a method to simultaneously detect AIV and identify the species-origin from faecal samples. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity of the species-identification RT-PCR was assessed on serial dilutions of faecal droppings. Overall sensitivity of the methods for species-identification and AIV detection was assessed on 92 faecal and cloacal samples collected from wildlife, poultry markets, and experimentally H5N1-infected birds. RESULTS: All 92 samples were correctly identified to 24 different species, with a detection limit of 2.8mug of faecal material. All 20 specimens previously shown by virus culture to be positive for influenza virus were correctly identified by RT-PCR for influenza A using the same nucleic-acid extracts used for species-identification. CONCLUSION: We have optimised and evaluated a method for identifying the species of origin and detecting AIV from bird faecal droppings that can be applied to routine surveillance of influenza viruses in wild-birds.},

abstract = {Left-right asymmetry is a crucial feature of the vertebrate body plan. While much molecular detail of this patterning pathway has been uncovered, the embryonic mechanisms of the initiation of asymmetry, and their evolutionary conservation among species, are still not understood. A popular recent model based on data from mouse embryos suggests extracellular movement of determinants by ciliary motion at the gastrulating node as the initial step. An alternative model, driven by findings in the frog and chick embryo, focuses instead on cytoplasmic roles of motor proteins. To begin to test the latter hypothesis, we analyzed the very early embryonic localization of ciliary targets implicated in mouse LR asymmetry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on frog and chick embryos using antibodies that have (KIF3B, Polaris, Polycystin-2, acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin) or have not (LRD, INV, detyrosinated $\alpha$-tubulin) been shown to detect in frog embryos only the target that they detect in mammalian tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization signals for all targets in the cytoplasm of cleavage-stage Xenopus embryos, and in the base of the primitive streak in chick embryos at streak initiation. Importantly, several left-right asymmetries were detected in both species, and the localization signals were dependent on microtubule and actin cytoskeletal organization. Moreover, loss-of-function experiments implicated very early intracellular microtubule-dependent motor protein function as an obligate aspect of oriented LR asymmetry in Xenopus embryos. These data are consistent with cytoplasmic roles for motor proteins in patterning the left-right axis that do not involve ciliary motion. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Cloning is an essential prerequisite to test protein design and engineering ideas. However, it is often time consuming, unreliable, and therefore frustrating. Here, we present a streamlined cloning strategy that incorporates a powerful white and green screening protocol to identify colonies with inserts. We use circular polymerase extension cloning, which is both ligation and sequence independent. Furthermore, our entire procedure requires only three quick steps and one enzyme making it easy to use, inexpensive, and tractable. We anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for protein engineers who frequently subclone or make focused deletion, insertion, or substitution libraries. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Protein Society.},

@article{Corpet1988,
abstract = {An algorithm is presented for the multiple alignment of sequences, either proteins or nucleic acids, that is both accurate and easy to use on microcomputers. The approach is based on the conventional dynamic-programming method of pairwise alignment. Initially, a hierarchical clustering of the sequences is performed using the matrix of the pairwise alignment scores. The closest sequences are aligned creating groups of aligned sequences. Then close groups are aligned until all sequences are aligned in one group. The pairwise alignments included in the multiple alignment form a new matrix that is used to produce a hierarchical clustering. If it is different from the first one, iteration of the process can be performed. The method is illustrated by an example: a global alignment of 39 sequences of cytochrome c.},
